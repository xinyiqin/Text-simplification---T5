G11.1	drones	2892036907	G11.1_2892036907_1	In the modern era of automation and robotics, autonomous vehicles are currently the focus of academic and industrial research.
G11.1	drones	2892036907	G11.1_2892036907_2	With the ever increasing number of unmanned aerial vehicles getting involved in activities in the civilian and commercial domain, there is an increased need for autonomy in these systems too.
G11.1	drones	2892036907	G11.1_2892036907_3	Due to guidelines set by the governments regarding the operation ceiling of civil drones, road-tracking based navigation is garnering interest.
G11.1	drones	2892036907	G11.1_2892036907_4	In an attempt to achieve the above mentioned tasks, we propose an imitation learning based, data-driven solution to UAV autonomy for navigating through city streets by learning to fly by imitating an expert pilot.
G11.1	drones	2892036907	G11.1_2892036907_5	Derived from the classic image classification algorithms, our classifier has been constructed in the form of a fast 39-layered Inception model, that evaluates the presence of roads using the tomographic reconstructions of the input frames.
G11.1	drones	2892036907	G11.1_2892036907_6	Based on the Inception-v3 architecture, our system performs better in terms of processing complexity and accuracy than many existing models for imitation learning.
G11.1	drones	2892036907	G11.1_2892036907_7	The data used for training the system has been captured from the drone, by flying it in and around urban and semi-urban streets, by experts having at least 6-8 years of flying experience.
G11.1	drones	2892036907	G11.1_2892036907_8	Permissions were taken from required authorities who made sure that minimal risk (to pedestrians) is involved in the data collection process.
G11.1	drones	2892036907	G11.1_2892036907_9	With the extensive amount of drone data that we collected, we have been able to navigate successfully through roads without crashing or overshooting, with an accuracy of 98.44%.
G11.1	drones	2892036907	G11.1_2892036907_10	The computational efficiency of MAVNet enables the drone to fly at high speeds of up to 6m/sec.
G11.1	drones	2892036907	G11.1_2892036907_11	We present the same results in this research and compare them with other state-of-the-art methods of vision and learning based navigation.
G06.2	self driving	2889433965	G06.2_2889433965_1	Recognizing Traffic Signs using intelligent systems can drastically reduce the number of accidents happening world-wide.
G06.2	self driving	2889433965	G06.2_2889433965_2	With the arrival of Self-driving cars it has become a staple challenge to solve the automatic recognition of Traffic and Hand-held signs in the major streets.
G06.2	self driving	2889433965	G06.2_2889433965_3	Various machine learning techniques like Random Forest, SVM as well as deep learning models has been proposed for classifying traffic signs.
G06.2	self driving	2889433965	G06.2_2889433965_4	Though they reach state-of-the-art performance on a particular data-set, but fall short of tackling multiple Traffic Sign Recognition benchmarks.
G06.2	self driving	2889433965	G06.2_2889433965_5	In this paper, we propose a novel and one-for-all architecture that aces multiple benchmarks with better overall score than the state-of-the-art architectures.
G06.2	self driving	2889433965	G06.2_2889433965_6	Our model is made of residual convolutional blocks with hierarchical dilated skip connections joined in steps.
G06.2	self driving	2889433965	G06.2_2889433965_7	With this we score 99.33% Accuracy in German sign recognition benchmark and 99.17% Accuracy in Belgian traffic sign classification benchmark.
G06.2	self driving	2889433965	G06.2_2889433965_8	Moreover, we propose a newly devised dilated residual learning representation technique which is very low in both memory and computational complexity.
G06.2	self driving	2810968146	G06.2_2810968146_1	We introduce Ignition: an end-to-end neural network architecture for training unconstrained self-driving vehicles in simulated environments.
G06.2	self driving	2810968146	G06.2_2810968146_2	The model is a ResNet-18 variant, which is fed in images from the front of a simulated F1 car, and outputs optimal labels for steering, throttle, braking.
G06.2	self driving	2810968146	G06.2_2810968146_3	Importantly, we never explicitly train the model to detect road features like the outline of a track or distance to other cars; instead, we illustrate that these latent features can be automatically encapsulated by the network.
G06.2	self driving	2890116921	G06.2_2890116921_1	In this paper, we present a transfer learning method for the end-to-end control of self-driving cars, which enables a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a source domain to be utilized for the same task in a different target domain.
G06.2	self driving	2890116921	G06.2_2890116921_2	A conventional CNN for the end-to-end control is designed to map a single front-facing camera image to a steering command.
G06.2	self driving	2890116921	G06.2_2890116921_3	To enable the transfer learning, we let the CNN produce not only a steering command but also a lane departure level (LDL) by adding a new task module, which takes the output of the last convolutional layer as input.
G06.2	self driving	2890116921	G06.2_2890116921_4	The CNN trained on the source domain, called source network, is then utilized to train another task module called target network, which also takes the output of the last convolutional layer of the source network and is trained to produce a steering command for the target domain.
G06.2	self driving	2890116921	G06.2_2890116921_5	The steering commands from the source and target network are finally merged according to the LDL and the merged command is utilized for controlling a car in the target domain.
G06.2	self driving	2890116921	G06.2_2890116921_6	To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we utilized two simulators, TORCS and GTAV, for the source and the target domains, respectively.
G06.2	self driving	2890116921	G06.2_2890116921_7	Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other baseline methods in terms of stable and safe control of cars.
G06.2	self driving	2805209921	G06.2_2805209921_1	A significant problem of using deep learning techniques is the limited amount of data available for training.
G06.2	self driving	2805209921	G06.2_2805209921_2	There are some datasets available for the popular problems like item recognition and classification for self-driving cars, however, it is very limited for the industrial robotics field.
G06.2	self driving	2805209921	G06.2_2805209921_3	In previous work, we have trained a multi-objective Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify the robot body in the image and estimate 3D positions of the joints by using just a 2D image, but it was limited to a range of robots produced by Universal Robots (UR).
G06.2	self driving	2805209921	G06.2_2805209921_4	In this work, we extend our method to work with a new robot arm - Kuka LBR iiwa, which has a significantly different appearance and an additional joint.
G06.2	self driving	2805209921	G06.2_2805209921_5	However, instead of collecting large datasets once again, we collect a number of smaller datasets containing a few hundred frames each and use transfer learning techniques on the CNN trained on UR robots to adapt it to a new robot having different shapes and visual features.
G06.2	self driving	2805209921	G06.2_2805209921_6	We have proven that transfer learning is not only applicable in this field, but it requires smaller well-prepared training datasets, trains significantly faster and reaches similar accuracy compared to the original method, even improving it on some aspects.
G06.2	self driving	2897082611	G06.2_2897082611_1	Moral responsibility is a major concern in automated decision-making, with applications ranging from self-driving cars to kidney exchanges.
G06.2	self driving	855132903	G06.2_855132903_1	In this paper we present queueing-theoretical methods for the modeling, analysis, and control of autonomous mobility-on-demand MOD systems wherein robotic, self-driving vehicles transport customers within an urban environment and rebalance themselves to ensure acceptable quality of service throughout the network.
G06.2	self driving	855132903	G06.2_855132903_2	We first cast an autonomous MOD system within a closed Jackson network model with passenger loss.
G06.2	self driving	855132903	G06.2_855132903_3	The theoretical insights are used to design a robust, real-time rebalancing algorithm, which is applied to a case study of New York City and implemented on an eight-vehicle mobile robot testbed.
G06.2	self driving	855132903	G06.2_855132903_4	The case study of New York shows that the current taxi demand in Manhattan can be met with about 8,000 robotic vehicles roughly 70% of the size of the current taxi fleet operating in Manhattan.
G06.2	self driving	855132903	G06.2_855132903_5	Finally, we extend our queueing-theoretical setup to include congestion effects, and study the impact of autonomously rebalancing vehicles on overall congestion.
G06.2	self driving	855132903	G06.2_855132903_6	Collectively, this paper provides a rigorous approach to the problem of system-wide coordination of autonomously driving vehicles, and provides one of the first characterizations of the sustainability benefits of robotic transportation networks.
G06.2	self driving	602340265	G06.2_602340265_1	In the wake of the on-going digital revolution, we will see a dramatic transformation of our economy and most of our societal institutions.
G06.2	self driving	602340265	G06.2_602340265_2	While the benefits of this transformation can be massive, there are also tremendous risks to our society.
G06.2	self driving	602340265	G06.2_602340265_3	After the automation of many production processes and the creation of self-driving vehicles, the automation of society is next.
G06.2	self driving	602340265	G06.2_602340265_4	This is moving us to a tipping point and to a crossroads: we must decide between a society in which the actions are determined in a top-down way and then implemented by coercion or manipulative technologies (such as personalized ads and nudging) or a society, in which decisions are taken in a free and participatory way and mutually coordinated.
G06.2	self driving	602340265	G06.2_602340265_5	Modern information and communication systems (ICT) enable both, but the latter has economic and strategic benefits.
G06.2	self driving	602340265	G06.2_602340265_6	The fundaments of human dignity, autonomous decision-making, and democracies are shaking, but I believe that they need to be vigorously defended, as they are not only core principles of livable societies, but also the basis of greater efficiency and success.
G06.2	self driving	2895666646	G06.2_2895666646_1	Once self-driving car becomes a reality and passengers are no longer worry about it, they will need to find new ways of entertainment.
G06.2	self driving	2895666646	G06.2_2895666646_2	However, retrieving entertainment contents at the Data Center (DC) can hinder content delivery service due to high delay of car-to-DC communication.
G06.2	self driving	2895666646	G06.2_2895666646_3	To address these challenges, we propose a deep learning based caching for self-driving car, by using Deep Learning approaches deployed on the Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) structure.
G06.2	self driving	2895666646	G06.2_2895666646_4	First, at DC, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is used to predict the probabilities of contents to be requested in specific areas.
G06.2	self driving	2895666646	G06.2_2895666646_5	To reduce the car-DC delay, MLP outputs are logged into MEC servers attached to roadside units.
G06.2	self driving	2895666646	G06.2_2895666646_6	Second, in order to cache entertainment contents stylized for car passengers’ features such as age and gender, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to predict age and gender of passengers.
G06.2	self driving	2895666646	G06.2_2895666646_7	Through this, the self-driving car can identify the contents need to be downloaded from the MEC server and cached.
G06.2	self driving	2895666646	G06.2_2895666646_8	Finally, we formulate deep learning based caching in the self-driving car that enhances entertainment services as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize content downloading delay.
G06.2	self driving	2895666646	G06.2_2895666646_9	To solve the formulated problem, a Block Successive Majorization-Minimization (BS-MM) technique is applied.
G06.2	self driving	2895666646	G06.2_2895666646_10	The simulation results show that the accuracy of our prediction for the contents need to be cached in the areas of the self-driving car is achieved at 98.04% and our approach can minimize delay.
G06.2	self driving	2891558151	G06.2_2891558151_1	This paper describes the design, implementation, and successful use of the Bristol Stock Exchange (BSE), a novel minimal simulation of a centralised financial market, based on a Limit Order Book (LOB) such as is common in major stock exchanges.
G06.2	self driving	2891558151	G06.2_2891558151_2	Construction of BSE was motivated by the fact that most of the world’s major financial markets have automated, with trading activity that previously was the responsibility of human traders now being performed by high-speed autonomous automated trading systems.
G06.2	self driving	2891558151	G06.2_2891558151_3	Research aimed at understanding the dynamics of this new style of financial market is hampered by the fact that no operational real-world exchange is ever likely to allow experimental probing of that market while it is open and running live, forcing researchers to work primarily from time-series of past trading data.
G06.2	self driving	2891558151	G06.2_2891558151_4	Similarly, university-level education of the engineers who can create next-generation automated trading systems requires that they have hands-on learning experience in a sufficiently realistic teaching environment.
G06.2	self driving	2891558151	G06.2_2891558151_5	BSE as described here addresses both those needs: it has been successfully used for teaching and research in a leading UK university since 2012, and the BSE program code is freely available as open-source on GitHuB.
G06.2	self driving	2801562232	G06.2_2801562232_1	This paper provides a holistic study of how stock prices vary in their response to financial disclosures across different topics.
G06.2	self driving	2801562232	G06.2_2801562232_2	Thereby, we specifically shed light into the extensive amount of filings for which no a priori categorization of their content exists.
G06.2	self driving	2801562232	G06.2_2801562232_3	For this purpose, we utilize an approach from data mining - namely, latent Dirichlet allocation - as a means of topic modeling.
G06.2	self driving	2801562232	G06.2_2801562232_4	This technique facilitates our task of automatically categorizing, ex ante, the content of more than 70,000 regulatory 8-K filings from U.S. companies.
G06.2	self driving	2801562232	G06.2_2801562232_5	We then evaluate the subsequent stock market reaction.
G06.2	self driving	2801562232	G06.2_2801562232_6	Our empirical evidence suggests a considerable discrepancy among various types of news stories in terms of their relevance and impact on financial markets.
G06.2	self driving	2801562232	G06.2_2801562232_7	For instance, we find a statistically significant abnormal return in response to earnings results and credit rating, but also for disclosures regarding business strategy, the health sector, as well as mergers and acquisitions.
G06.2	self driving	2801562232	G06.2_2801562232_8	Our results yield findings that benefit managers, investors and policy-makers by indicating how regulatory filings should be structured and the topics most likely to precede changes in stock valuations.
G06.2	self driving	835365303	G06.2_835365303_1	This paper addresses the financial markets problem space with particular emphasis on trading systems seen in banking today.
G06.2	self driving	835365303	G06.2_835365303_2	With the advent of modern computing, cross-regional trading transactions can now be executed within milliseconds, a reality that is impossible without the advancements of software systems technology.
G06.2	self driving	835365303	G06.2_835365303_3	We then move on and discuss the anatomy of a trading system and how it fits in with the banks ecosystem of vital inter-working components.
G06.2	self driving	2888477402	G06.2_2888477402_1	As for the humanoid robots, the internal noise, which is generated by motors, fans and mechanical components when the robot is moving or shaking its body, severely degrades the performance of the speech recognition accuracy.
G06.2	self driving	2888477402	G06.2_2888477402_2	In this paper, a novel speech recognition system robust to ego-noise for humanoid robots is proposed, in which on/off state of the motor is employed as auxiliary information for finding the relevant input features.
G06.2	self driving	2888477402	G06.2_2888477402_3	For this, we consider the bottleneck features, which have been successfully applied to deep neural network (DNN) based automatic speech recognition (ASR) system.
G06.2	self driving	2888477402	G06.2_2888477402_4	When learning the bottleneck features to catch, we first exploit the motor on/off state data as supplementary information in addition to the acoustic features as the input of the first deep neural network (DNN) for preliminary acoustic modeling.
G06.2	self driving	2888477402	G06.2_2888477402_5	Then, the second DNN for primary acoustic modeling employs both the bottleneck features tossed from the first DNN and the acoustics features.
G06.2	self driving	2888477402	G06.2_2888477402_6	When the proposed method is evaluated in terms of phoneme error rate (PER) on TIMIT database, the experimental results show that achieve obvious improvement (11% relative) is achieved by our algorithm over the conventional systems.
G06.2	self driving	89451762	G06.2_89451762_1	Many model based techniques have been proposed in the literature for applying domestic service tasks on humanoid robots, such as teleoperation, learning from demonstration and imitation.
G06.2	self driving	89451762	G06.2_89451762_2	However sensor based robot control overcomes many of the difficulties of uncertain models and unknown environments which limit the domain of application of the previous methods.
G06.2	self driving	89451762	G06.2_89451762_3	Furthermore, for service and manipulation tasks, it is more suitable to study the interaction between the robot and its environment at the contact point using the sensor based control, rather than specifying the joint positions and velocities required to achieve them.
G07.1	misinformation	2888100547	G07.1_2888100547_1	Online social media provide users with unprecedented opportunities to engage with diverse opinions.
G07.1	misinformation	2888100547	G07.1_2888100547_2	Simultaneously, they allow the spread of misinformation by empowering individuals to self-select the narratives they want to be exposed to, both through active (confirmation bias) and passive (personalized news algorithms) self-reinforcing mechanisms.
G07.1	misinformation	2888100547	G07.1_2888100547_3	A precise theoretical understanding of such trade-offs is still largely missing.
G07.1	misinformation	2888100547	G07.1_2888100547_4	We introduce a stylized social learning model where most participants in a network update their beliefs unbiasedly based on the arrival of new information, while a fraction of participants display confirmation bias, enabling them to reject news that are incongruent with their pre-existing beliefs.
G07.1	misinformation	2888100547	G07.1_2888100547_5	We show that this simple confirmation bias mechanism can generate permanent opinion polarisation.
G07.1	misinformation	2888100547	G07.1_2888100547_6	"Furthermore, the model results in states where unbiased agents behave ""as if"" they were biased, due to their biased neighbours effectively functioning as gatekeepers, restricting their access to free and diverse information."
G07.1	misinformation	2888100547	G07.1_2888100547_7	We derive analytic results for the distribution of individual agents’ beliefs, explicitly demonstrating the aforementioned trade-off between confirmation bias and social connectivity, which we further validate against US county-level data on the impact of Internet access on the formation of beliefs about global warming.
G07.1	misinformation	2888100547	G07.1_2888100547_8	Our findings indicate that confirmation bias in small doses may actually result in improved accuracy across individuals by preserving information diversity in a social network.
G07.1	misinformation	2888100547	G07.1_2888100547_9	However, results also indicate that when confirmation bias grows past an optimal value, accuracy declines as biased agents restrict information flow to subgroups.
G07.1	misinformation	2888100547	G07.1_2888100547_10	We discuss the policy implications of our model, highlighting the downside of debunking strategies and suggesting alternative strategies to contrast misinformation.
G07.1	misinformation	2803622358	G07.1_2803622358_1	The advent of WWW changed the way we can produce and access information.
G07.1	misinformation	2803622358	G07.1_2803622358_2	Recent studies showed that users tend to select information that is consistent with their system of beliefs, forming polarized groups of like-minded people around shared narratives where dissenting information is ignored.
G07.1	misinformation	2803622358	G07.1_2803622358_3	In this environment, users cooperate to frame and reinforce their shared narrative making any attempt at debunking inefficient.
G07.1	misinformation	2803622358	G07.1_2803622358_4	Such a configuration occurs even in the consumption of news online, and considering that 63% of users access news directly form social media, one hypothesis is that more polarization allows for further spreading of misinformation.
G07.1	misinformation	2803622358	G07.1_2803622358_5	Along this path, we focus on the polarization of users around news outlets on Facebook in different European countries (Italy, France, Spain and Germany).
G07.1	misinformation	2803622358	G07.1_2803622358_6	First, we compare the page posting behavior and the users interacting patterns across countries and observe different posting, liking and commenting rates.
G07.1	misinformation	2803622358	G07.1_2803622358_7	Second, we explore the tendency of users to interact with different pages (i.e., selective exposure) and the emergence of polarized communities generated around specific pages.
G07.1	misinformation	2803622367	G07.1_2803622367_1	We find that Italy is the most polarized country, followed by France, Germany and lastly Spain.
G07.1	misinformation	2803622367	G07.1_2803622367_2	Finally, we present a variation of the Bounded Confidence Model to simulate the emergence of these communities by considering the usersu0027 engagement and trust on the news.
G07.1	misinformation	2803622367	G07.1_2803622367_3	Our findings suggest that trust in information broadcaster plays a pivotal role against polarization of users online.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2898599358	G08.1_2898599358_1	For decentralised P2P networks, it is very important to have a mechanism in place that allows the nodes to control resource usage and prevent flooding and denial-of-service attacks with spam.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2898599358	G08.1_2898599358_2	In this paper, we discuss and compare the different approaches to fully decentralised resource control that are used by projects in the cryptocurrency space.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2898599358	G08.1_2898599358_3	The introduced methods are then applied to design a decentralised exchange for Namecoin names (or more generally, crypto assets) as an example.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2889349357	G08.1_2889349357_1	With the introduction of memory-bound cryptocurrencies, such as Monero, the implementation of mining code in browser-based JavaScript has become a worthwhile alternative to dedicated mining rigs.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2889349357	G08.1_2889349357_2	Based on this technology, a new form of parasitic computing, widely called cryptojacking or drive-by mining, has gained momentum in the web. A cryptojacking site abuses the computing resources of its visitors to covertly mine for cryptocurrencies.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2889349357	G08.1_2889349357_3	In this paper, we systematically explore this phenomenon. For this, we propose a 3-phase analysis approach, which enables us to identify mining scripts and conduct a large-scale study on the prevalence of cryptojacking in the Alexa 1 million websites.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2889349357	G08.1_2889349357_4	We find that cryptojacking is common, with currently 1 out of 500 sites hosting a mining script.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2889349357	G08.1_2889349357_5	Moreover, we perform several secondary analyses to gain insight into the cryptojacking landscape, including a measurement of code characteristics, an estimate of expected mining revenue, and an evaluation of current blacklist-based countermeasures.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2889740224	G08.1_2889740224_1	The rise of modern blockchains has facilitated the emergence of smart contracts: autonomous programs that live and run on the blockchain.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2889740224	G08.1_2889740224_2	"Smart contracts have seen a rapid climb to prominence, with applications predicted in law, business, commerce, and governance.  contracts :[39],""are commonly written in a high-level language such as Ethereumu0027s Solidity, and translated to compact low-level bytecode for deployment on the blockchain."
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2889740224	G08.1_2889740224_3	Once deployed, the bytecode is autonomously executed, usually by a %Turing-complete virtual machine.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2889740224	G08.1_2889740224_4	As with all programs, smart contracts can be highly vulnerable to malicious attacks due to deficient programming methodologies, languages, and toolchains, including buggy compilers.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2889740224	G08.1_2889740224_5	"At the same time, smart contracts :[39],""are also high-value targets, often commanding large amounts of cryptocurrency."
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2889740224	G08.1_2889740224_6	Hence, developers and auditors need security frameworks capable of analysing low-level bytecode to detect potential security vulnerabilities.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2889740224	G08.1_2889740224_7	In this paper, we present Vandal: a security analysis framework for Ethereum smart contracts.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2889740224	G08.1_2889740224_8	Vandal consists of an analysis pipeline that converts low-level Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode to semantic logic relations.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2889740224	G08.1_2889740224_9	Users of the framework can express security analyses in a declarative fashion: a security analysis is expressed in a logic specification written in the \souffle language.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2889740235	G08.1_2889740235_1	Vandal is both fast and robust, successfully analysing over 95\% of all 141k unique contracts with an average runtime of 4.15 seconds; outperforming the current state of the art tools---Oyente, EthIR, Mythril, and Rattle---under equivalent conditions.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2895247503	G08.1_2895247503_1	As Bitcoinu0027s popularity has grown over the decade since its creation, it has become an increasingly attractive target for adversaries of all kinds.
G09.1	forensics	754200012	G09.1_754200012_1	Image tampering, being readily facilitated and proliferated by today’s digital techniques, is increasingly causing problems regarding the authenticity of images.
G09.1	forensics	754200012	G09.1_754200012_2	As the most popular multimedia data, JPEG images can be easily tampered without leaving any clues; therefore, JPEG-based forensics , including the detection of double compression, interpolation, rotation, etc., has become an active research topic in multimedia forensics.
G09.1	forensics	754200012	G09.1_754200012_3	Nevertheless, the interesting issue of detecting image tampering and its related operations by using the same quantization matrix has not been fully investigated.
G09.1	forensics	754200012	G09.1_754200012_4	Aiming to detect such forgery manipulations under the same quantization matrix, we propose a detection method by using shift-recompression -based reshuffle characteristic features.
G09.1	forensics	754200012	G09.1_754200012_5	The learning classifiers are applied for classification.
G09.1	forensics	754200012	G09.1_754200012_6	Our experimental results indicate that the approach is indeed highly effective in detecting image tampering and relevant manipulations with the same quantization matrix.
G09.1	forensics	567125047	G09.1_567125047_1	The malicious alteration of machine time is a big challenge in computer forensics.
G09.1	forensics	567125047	G09.1_567125047_2	Detecting such changes and reconstructing the actual timeline of events is of paramount importance.
G09.1	forensics	567125047	G09.1_567125047_3	However, this can be difficult since the attacker has many opportunities and means to hide such changes.
G09.1	forensics	567125047	G09.1_567125047_4	In particular, cloud computing, host and guest machine time can be manipulated in various ways by an attacker.
G09.1	forensics	567125047	G09.1_567125047_5	Guest virtual machines are especially vulnerable to attacks coming from their (more privileged) host.
G09.1	forensics	567125047	G09.1_567125047_6	As such, it is important to guarantee the timeline integrity of both hosts and guests in a cloud, or at least to ensure that the alteration of such timeline does not go undetected.
G09.1	forensics	567125047	G09.1_567125047_7	In this paper we survey the issues related to host and guest machine time integrity in the cloud.
G09.1	forensics	567125047	G09.1_567125047_8	Further, we describe a novel architecture for host and guest time alteration detection and correction/resilience with respect to compromised hosts and guests.
G09.1	forensics	567125047	G09.1_567125047_9	The proposed framework has been implemented on an especially built simulator.
G09.1	forensics	567125047	G09.1_567125047_10	Performance figures show the feasibility of our proposal.
G09.1	forensics	2885025643	G09.1_2885025643_1	Detection of different types of image editing operations carried out on an image is an important problem in image forensics.
G09.1	forensics	2885025643	G09.1_2885025643_2	It gives the information about the processing history of an image, and also can expose forgeries present in an image.
G09.1	forensics	2885025643	G09.1_2885025643_3	There have been a few methods proposed to detect different types of image editing operations in a single framework.
G09.1	forensics	2885025643	G09.1_2885025643_4	However, all the operations have to be known a priori in the training phase.
G09.1	forensics	2885025643	G09.1_2885025643_5	But, in real-forensics scenarios it may not be possible to know about the editing operations carried out on an image.
G09.1	forensics	2885025643	G09.1_2885025643_6	To solve this problem, we propose a novel deep learning-based method which can differentiate between different types of image editing operations.
G09.1	forensics	2885025643	G09.1_2885025643_7	The proposed method classifies image patches in a pair-wise fashion as either similarly or differently processed using a deep siamese neural network.
G09.1	forensics	2885025643	G09.1_2885025643_8	Once the network learns feature that can discriminate between different image editing operations, it can differentiate between different image editing operations not present in the training stage.
G09.1	forensics	2885025643	G09.1_2885025643_9	The experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed method in detecting/discriminating different image editing operations.
G01.1	Digital assistant	2797641221	G01.1_2797641221_1	Digital assistants are emerging to become more prevalent in our daily lives. In interacting with these assistants, users may engage in multiple tasks within a short period of time.
G01.1	Digital assistant	2463945949	G01.1_2463945949_1	DIANE is a digital assistant system that aims to fasten the doctor access to various informations at the hospital such as health care facility, medical records, and also human resource data. The fasten access could be achieved by implementing face recognition and live streaming as part of the digital assistant system.
G01.2	Biases	1448624402	G01.2_1448624402_1	As extensive experimental research has shown individuals suffer from diverse biases in decision-making.
G01.2	Biases	1448624402	G01.2_1448624402_2	In our paper we analyze the effects of decision-making biases of managers in collaborative decision processes on organizational performance.
G01.2	Biases	1448624402	G01.2_1448624402_3	In the simulations, managerial decisions which are based on different levels of organizational complexity and different incentive systems suffer from biases known from descriptive decision theory.
G01.2	Biases	1448624402	G01.2_1448624402_4	The results illustrate how biases in combination with each other and in different organizational contexts affect organizational performance.
G01.2	Biases	1448624402	G01.2_1448624402_5	We find that, contrary to intuition, some combinations of biases significantly improve organizational performance while these biases negatively affect organizational performance when they occur separately.
G01.2	Biases	1448624402	G01.2_1448624402_6	This might evoke considerations whether decision-making should be as rational as possible.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2968701259	G10.1_2968701259_1	Perception of the local environment is a precondition for mobile robots to navigate safely in dynamic environments.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2968701259	G10.1_2968701259_2	Most robots, i.e., humanoids and smaller wheeled robots rely on planar regions.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2968701259	G10.1_2968701259_3	For humanoids, a simple 2D occupancy map as environment representation on which a path is planned is hereby not sufficient since they can step over and onto objects and therefore need height information.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2968701259	G10.1_2968701259_4	Considering dynamic obstacles introduces another level of complexity, since they can lead to necessary replanning or collisions at later stages.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2968701259	G10.1_2968701259_5	In this paper, we present a framework that first extracts planar regions in height maps and detects dynamic obstacles.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2968701259	G10.1_2968701259_6	Our system then uses this information to create a set of prediction maps, in which paths can be efficiently planned in real time at low CPU cost.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2968701259	G10.1_2968701259_7	We show in simulation and real-world experiments that our framework keeps run times well under 10ms for one computation cycle and allows for foresighted real-time 3D footstep planning.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2906808597	G10.1_2906808597_1	An autonomous service robot often first has to search for a user to carry out a desired task.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2906808597	G10.1_2906808597_2	This is a challenging problem, especially when this person moves around since the robot’s field of view is constrained and the environment structure typically poses further visibility constraints that influence the perception of the user.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2906808597	G10.1_2906808597_3	In this paper, we propose a novel method that computes the likelihood of the user’s observability at each possible location in the environment based on Monte Carlo simulations.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2906808597	G10.1_2906808597_4	As the robot needs time to reach the possible search locations, we take this time as well as the visibility constraints into account when computing effective search locations.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2906808597	G10.1_2906808597_5	In this way, the robot can choose the next search location that has the maximum expected observability of the user.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2906808597	G10.1_2906808597_6	Our experiments in various simulated environments demonstrate that our approach leads to a significantly shorter search time compared to a greedy approach with background information.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2773777794	G10.1_2773777794_1	In many situations, users walk on typical paths between specific destinations at which the service of a mobile robot is needed.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2773777794	G10.1_2773777794_2	Depending on the environment and the paths, step-by-step following of the human might not be the optimal solution since better paths for the robot exist.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2773777794	G10.1_2773777794_3	We propose to perform a prediction about the human's future movements and use this information in a reinforcement learning framework to generate foresighted navigation actions for the robot.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2773777794	G10.1_2773777794_4	Since frequent occlusions of the human will occur due to obstacles and the robot's constrained field of view, the estimate about the humans's position and the prediction of the next destination are affected by uncertainty.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2773777794	G10.1_2773777794_5	Our approach deals with such situations by explicitly considering occlusions in the reward function such that the robot automatically considers to execute actions to get the human in its field of view.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2773777794	G10.1_2773777794_6	We show in simulated and real-world experiments that our technique leads to significantly shorter paths compared to an approach in which the robot always tries to closely follow the user and, additionally, can handle occlusions.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2562908749	G10.1_2562908749_1	In this paper, we introduce an approach to efficient robot navigation through cluttered indoor environments.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2562908749	G10.1_2562908749_2	We propose to estimate local obstacle densities based on already detected objects and use them to predict traversal costs corresponding to potential obstacles in regions not yet observable by the robot's sensors.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2562908749	G10.1_2562908749_3	By taking into account the predicted costs for path planning, the robot is then able to navigate in a more foresighted manner and reduces the risk of getting stuck in cluttered regions.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2562908749	G10.1_2562908749_4	As the experimental results demonstrate, our method enables the robot to efficiently navigate through environments containing cluttered regions and achieves significantly shorter completion times compared to a standard approach not using any prediction.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2093013061	G10.1_2093013061_1	In this paper, we present an integrated navigation system that allows humanoid robots to autonomously navigate in unknown, cluttered environments.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2093013061	G10.1_2093013061_2	From the data of an onboard consumer-grade depth camera, our system estimates the robot's pose to compensate for drift of odometry and maintains a heightmap representation of the environment.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2093013061	G10.1_2093013061_3	Based on this model, our system iteratively computes sequences of safe actions including footsteps and whole-body motions, leading the robot to target locations.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2093013061	G10.1_2093013061_4	To efficiently check for collisions during planning, we developed a new approach that takes into account the shape of the robot and the obstacles.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2093013061	G10.1_2093013061_5	As we demonstrate in experiments with a Nao humanoid, our system leads to robust navigation in cluttered environments and the robot is able to traverse highly challenging passages.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1593729956	G10.1_1593729956_1	In this paper, we present a novel approach to accurately calibrate the kinematic model of a humanoid based on observations of its monocular camera.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1593729956	G10.1_1593729956_2	Our technique estimates the parameters of the complete model, consisting of the joint angle offsets of the whole body including the legs, as well as the camera extrinsic and intrinsic parameters.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1593729956	G10.1_1593729956_3	Furthermore, we developed an approach to automatically select a subset of configurations for the calibration process that yields a good trade-off between the number of observations and accuracy.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1593729956	G10.1_1593729956_4	Further, our approach to configuration selection yields substantially better optimization results compared to randomly chosen viable configurations.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1593729956	G10.1_1593729956_5	Hence, our system only requires a reduced number of configurations to achieve accurate results.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1593729956	G10.1_1593729956_6	Our optimization is general and the implementation, which is available online, can easily be applied to different humanoids.
G11.1	drones	2794850674	G11.1_2794850674_1	In this paper, a lab automation drone notional concept is introduced.
G11.1	drones	2794850674	G11.1_2794850674_2	Here, a robotic limb is attached to a robotic rotorcraft.
G11.1	drones	2794850674	G11.1_2794850674_3	The limb's gripper allows the unmanned aerial vehicle to dexterously manipulate objects such as micro-arrays and test tubes often used in high throughput systems (HTS).
G11.1	drones	2794850674	G11.1_2794850674_4	The resulting drone could augment existing HTS operations.
G11.1	drones	2794850674	G11.1_2794850674_5	The 6 degree-of-freedom (DOF) arm and gripper design are presented.
G11.1	drones	2794850674	G11.1_2794850674_6	Test-and-evaluation approach and results are also given.
G11.1	drones	2795365350	G11.1_2795365350_1	Robot companionship has become more popular in past years.
G11.1	drones	2795365350	G11.1_2795365350_2	However, humanoid gait might be somewhat unstable for these applications.
G11.1	drones	2795365350	G11.1_2795365350_3	Even with miniature humanoids, falls occur frequently.
G11.1	drones	2795365350	G11.1_2795365350_4	Thus, wheel attachments have been added onto a miniature humanoid, so it can move faster and with more stability than walking.
G11.1	drones	2795365350	G11.1_2795365350_5	In addition, with such attachments a robot can switch from walking to rolling when necessary.
G11.1	drones	2795365350	G11.1_2795365350_6	DARwIn-OP is a humanoid robot that has been used as an experimentation and performance evaluation platform.
G11.1	drones	2795365350	G11.1_2795365350_7	This paper discusses preliminary work regarding robot companionship applications by using a miniature humanoid capable of fetching different toys based on voice command.
G11.1	drones	2946157960	G11.1_2946157960_1	Advances in electronics and sensor technology have widened the scopes of networked drones to include applications as diverse as surveillance, video recording, operations, entertainment/advertising, signal emission, transportation, and delivery.
G11.1	drones	2946157960	G11.1_2946157960_2	These applications and services require video recording for their operations.
G11.1	drones	2946157960	G11.1_2946157960_3	Large drones are used singly in missions while small ones are used in formations or swarms.
G11.1	drones	2946157960	G11.1_2946157960_4	The small drones are proving to be useful in civilian applications.
G11.1	drones	2946157960	G11.1_2946157960_5	Consideration of small drones for the applications such as group flight, entertainment, and signal emission lead to deployment of networked drones.
G11.1	drones	2946157960	G11.1_2946157960_6	To develop group display applications, a real-time drone formation control for group display is proposed.
G11.1	drones	2946157960	G11.1_2946157960_7	Simulation shows that drone formation can display messages effectively.
G13.1	digital marketing	3004169763	G13.1_3004169763_1	The prevalence and rapid development of the Internet and mobile technology in recent decades has revamped our living styles and daily habits.
G13.1	digital marketing	3004169763	G13.1_3004169763_2	To ride on the digital trend, more business activities have been engaged in the digital world.
G13.1	digital marketing	3004169763	G13.1_3004169763_3	Marketing and advertising is one of typical business areas that is transformed digitally.
G13.1	digital marketing	3004169763	G13.1_3004169763_4	The rise of Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs), social media platforms, and Omni-channel retailing have attracted countless business entities to consider the adoption of digital marketing tools for promoting and advertising their brands and products.
G13.1	digital marketing	3004169763	G13.1_3004169763_5	However, with the increasing diversity of the types of digital marketing tools, they must be carefully selected based on a multiple number of criterion.
G13.1	digital marketing	3004169763	G13.1_3004169763_6	In this paper, a fuzzy-AHP method is proposed and developed for assisting industry practitioners in systematically and effectively evaluate and select proper digital marketing tool(s) for adoption.
G13.1	digital marketing	3004169763	G13.1_3004169763_7	The developed method not only streamlines the internal business process of digital marketing tool selection, but it also increases the practitioner's effectiveness of achieving the pre-defined strategic marketing objectives.
G13.1	digital marketing	2570453702	G13.1_2570453702_1	This study focuses on the digital marketing capabilities of tourism SMEs.
G13.1	digital marketing	2570453702	G13.1_2570453702_2	The study addresses the question of how the use of ICT-based tools benefit the organisational capabilities of a company.
G13.1	digital marketing	2570453702	G13.1_2570453702_3	By adopting marketing as a set-of-skills approach, the study provides new insights into the existing tourism literature on e-marketing.
G13.1	digital marketing	2570453702	G13.1_2570453702_4	Initial findings indicate that the digital marketing capabilities of companies are transformed through ICT-based uptake.
G13.1	digital marketing	2570453702	G13.1_2570453702_5	Four major capabilities were identified, each of which evolves as a result of using the tools.
G13.1	digital marketing	2570453702	G13.1_2570453702_6	A key finding of the study is that the use of ICT-based tools transforms digital marketing capabilities from a set of abilities that enables tourism SMEs not only to float in a web-marketing stream, but also to lead such a stream.
G02.2	Privacy	2134216589	G02.2_2134216589_1	Big data, the enhanced ability to collect, store and analyze previously unimaginable quantities of data in tremendous speed and with negligible costs, delivers immense benefits in marketing efficiency, healthcare, environmental protection, national security and more.
G02.2	Privacy	2134216589	G02.2_2134216589_2	The central tenets of the current privacy framework, the principles of data minimization and purpose limitation, are severely strained by the big data technological and business reality.
G02.2	Privacy	2134216589	G02.2_2134216589_3	As we increasingly interact with these artificial agents in unsupervised settings, with no human mediators, their seeming autonomy and increasingly sophisticated functionality and behavior, raises legal and philosophical questions.
G02.2	Privacy	2134216589	G02.2_2134216589_4	The focus on the machine is a distraction from the debate surrounding data driven ethical dilemmas, such as privacy, fairness and discrimination.
G02.2	Privacy	2134216589	G02.2_2134216589_5	The machine may exacerbate, enable, or simply draw attention to the ethical challenges, but it is humans who must be held accountable.
G02.2	Privacy	2134216589	G02.2_2134216589_6	Policymakers should seek to devise agreed-upon guidelines for ethical data analysis and profiling.
G02.2	Privacy	2134216589	G02.2_2134216589_7	Such guidelines would address the use of legal and technical mechanisms to obfuscate data; criteria for calling out unethical, if not illegal, behavior; categories of privacy and non-privacy harms; and strategies for empowering individuals through access to data in intelligible form.
G03.1	smart speaker	2960901639	G03.1_2960901639_1	As smart speakers with voice interaction capability permeate continuously in the world, more and more people will gradually get used to the new interaction medium–voice.
G03.1	smart speaker	2960901639	G03.1_2960901639_2	Although speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP) have been greatly improved over the past few years, users still may encounter errors from time to time like “cannot understand”, “no requested audio resource (such as music)”, which can frustrate users.
G03.1	smart speaker	2960901639	G03.1_2960901639_3	Therefore, when an error message is reported, it is vital that the smart speaker gives an effective and proper response.
G03.1	smart speaker	2960901639	G03.1_2960901639_4	However, currently the response strategies adopted by leading smart speaker brands in China differed mainly on two dimensions: “apology or not” and “humor or neutral”.
G03.1	smart speaker	2960901639	G03.1_2960901639_5	We explored user’s preference of response strategies under two error scenarios——“cannot understand” and “no requested audio resource”.
G03.1	smart speaker	2960901639	G03.1_2960901639_6	Two dependent variables (satisfaction and perceived sincerity of response) were measured.
G03.1	smart speaker	2960901639	G03.1_2960901639_7	The results showed that participants were more satisfied and perceived higher sincerity when smart speaker apologized in both error scenarios.
G03.1	smart speaker	2960901639	G03.1_2960901639_8	In the “no requested audio resource” scenario, humor had no significant impact on the perception of satisfaction and sincerity.
G03.1	smart speaker	2960901639	G03.1_2960901639_9	But in the “cannot understand” scenario, humorous expression decreased perceived sincerity.
G03.1	smart speaker	2949291273	G03.1_2949291273_1	the smart speakers cannot distinguish human voice from machine voice.
G03.1	smart speaker	2949291273	G03.1_2949291273_2	a method to identify which of human or machine is sending voice commands to a smart speaker is desired.
G03.1	smart speaker	2949291273	G03.1_2949291273_3	to prevent such machine-voice based attacks to a smart speaker in absence of residents, we propose a system consisting of a speaker and a microphone array to detect the existence of a human nearby, supposing it can be incorporated in a smart speaker in the future.
G03.1	smart speaker	2943753439	G03.1_2943753439_1	Amazon's Echo, and Apple's Siri have drawn attention from different user groups; however, these existing commercial VUIs support limited language options for users including native English speakers and non-native English speakers.
G03.1	smart speaker	2943753439	G03.1_2943753439_2	we conducted a usability study of the Google Home Smart Speaker with 20 participants including native English and non-native English speakers to understand their differences in using the Google Home Smart Speaker.
G03.1	smart speaker	2943753439	G03.1_2943753439_3	The findings show that compared with their counterparts, the native English speakers had better and more positive user experiences in interacting with the device.
G03.1	smart speaker	2943753439	G03.1_2943753439_4	It also shows that users' English language proficiency plays an important role in interacting with VUIs.
G03.1	smart speaker	2943753439	G03.1_2943753439_5	The findings from this study can create insights for VUI designers and developers for implementing multiple language options and better voice recognition algorithms in VUIs for different user groups across the world.
G04.1	drug discovery	2214798411	G04.1_2214798411_1	A pharmacophore analysis approach was used to investigate and compare different classes of compounds relevant to the drug discovery process (specifically, drug molecules, compounds in high throughput screening libraries, combinatorial chemistry building blocks and nondrug molecules).
G04.1	drug discovery	2214798411	G04.1_2214798411_2	Significant differences were observed between the pharmacophore profiles obtained for the drug molecules and those obtained for the high-throughput screening compounds, which appear to be closely related to the nondrug pharmacophore distribution.
G04.1	drug discovery	2214798411	G04.1_2214798411_3	It is suggested that the analysis of pharmacophore profiles could be used as an additional tool for the property-based optimization of compound selection and library design processes, thus improving the odds of success in lead discovery projects.
G04.1	drug discovery	2339209416	G04.1_2339209416_1	Annotation of bioassay protocols using semantic web vocabulary is a way to make experiment descriptions machine-readable.
G04.1	drug discovery	2339209416	G04.1_2339209416_2	Protocols are communicated using concise scientific English, which precludes most kinds of analysis by software algorithms.
G04.1	drug discovery	2339209416	G04.1_2339209416_3	Given the availability of a sufficiently expressive ontology, some or all of the pertinent information can be captured by asserting a series of facts, expressed as semantic web triples (subject, predicate, object).
G04.1	drug discovery	2339209416	G04.1_2339209416_4	With appropriate annotation, assays can be searched, clustered, tagged and evaluated in a multitude of ways, analogous to other segments of drug discovery informatics.
G04.1	drug discovery	2339209416	G04.1_2339209416_5	The BioAssay Ontology (BAO) has been previously designed for this express purpose, and provides a layered hierarchy of meaningful terms which can be linked to.
G04.2	functional genomics	2415325177	G04.2_2415325177_1	Next generation sequencing (NGS) produces massive datasets consisting of billions of reads and up to thousands of samples.
G04.2	functional genomics	2415325177	G04.2_2415325177_2	Subsequent bioinformatic analysis is typically done with the help of open source tools, where each application performs a single step towards the final result.
G04.2	functional genomics	2415325177	G04.2_2415325177_3	This situation leaves the bioinformaticians with the tasks to combine the tools, manage the data files and meta-information, document the analysis, and ensure reproducibility.

G04.3	infectious diseases	2941964798	G04.3_2941964798_2	Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has provided a powerful tool in identifying the genetic variation and constructing the correlations between genotype and phenotype in humans and other species.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2941964798	G04.3_2941964798_3	a Bayesian framework for genotype estimation for mixtures of multiple bacteria, named as Genetic Polymorphisms Assignments (GPA) has reduced the false discovery rate (FDR) and mean absolute error (MAE) in single nucleotide variant (SNV) identification.
G05.1	gene editing	2757079914	G05.1_2757079914_1	CRISPR-Cas is a tool that is widely used for gene editing.
G05.1	gene editing	2757079914	G05.1_2757079914_2	However, unexpected off-target effects may occur as a result of long-term nuclease activity.
G05.1	gene editing	2757079914	G05.1_2757079914_3	Anti-CRISPR proteins, which are powerful molecules that inhibit the CRISPR-Cas system, may have the potential to promote better utilization of the CRISPR-Cas system in gene editing, especially for gene therapy.
G05.1	gene editing	2757079914	G05.1_2757079914_4	Additionally, more in-depth research on these proteins would help researchers to better understand the co-evolution of bacteria and phages.
G05.1	gene editing	2757079914	G05.1_2757079914_5	Therefore, it is necessary to collect and integrate data on various types of anti-CRISPRs.
G05.1	gene editing	2117924928	G05.1_2117924928_1	The CRISPR/Cas9 system was recently developed as a powerful and flexible technology for targeted genome engineering, including genome editing (altering the genetic sequence) and gene regulation (without altering the genetic sequence).
G05.1	gene editing	2117924928	G05.1_2117924928_2	These applications require the design of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) that are efficient and specific.
G05.1	gene editing	2117924928	G05.1_2117924928_3	However, this remains challenging, as it requires the consideration of many criteria.
G05.1	gene editing	2914002216	G05.1_2914002216_1	CRISPR has become a hot research area ever since its advent for its efficiency and specificity in editing almost every section of DNA sequences.
G05.1	gene editing	2914002216	G05.1_2914002216_2	Based on its function of gene perturbation, a variety of gene editing techniques have been developed to achieve different aims.
G05.1	gene editing	2914002216	G05.1_2914002216_3	The target locations of a DNA strain can be precisely broken and repaired, during which the genes can be removed, repaired, silenced, or activated.
G05.1	gene editing	2914002216	G05.1_2914002216_4	The high efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9 reagents preparation and the easiness of experiment conduction make it now a powerful tool of high-content screen.
G05.1	gene editing	2584932255	G05.1_2584932255_1	The hidden connection between these reports is that gene editing could be used to solve issues related to health care allocation.
G05.1	gene editing	2584932255	G05.1_2584932255_2	Improving the health of future generations might coincide with public health goals; it might improve the health of individuals and communities, and, if successful, might be seen as a public good.
G05.1	gene editing	2584932255	G05.1_2584932255_3	However, enhancing future generations will require In Vitro Fertilisation and Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis.
G05.1	gene editing	2584932255	G05.1_2584932255_4	Remarkably, the necessary involvement of women in an enhancing scenario has not been discussed by its proponents.
G05.1	gene editing	2584932255	G05.1_2584932255_5	The present discourse on moral obligations of future generations, although not referring to women, seems to imply that women might be required, morally, if not legally, to reproduce with IVF.
G05.1	gene editing	2584932255	G05.1_2584932255_6	Enhancing future generations will be gendered, unless the artificial womb is developed.
G05.1	gene editing	2584932255	G05.1_2584932255_7	These are challenging issues that require a wider perspective, of both women and men.
G05.1	gene editing	2584932255	G05.1_2584932255_8	Despite the lack of a unified feminist conclusion in the discussions about the merits and risks of human genome modification, there is an urgent need to clarify the role of women in this scenario.
G05.2	crispr	2796443924	G05.2_2796443924_1	The CRISPR-Cpf1 system has been successfully applied in genome editing.
G05.2	crispr	2796443924	G05.2_2796443924_2	However, target efficiency of the CRISPR-Cpf1 system varies among different gRNA sequences.
G05.2	crispr	2796443924	G05.2_2796443924_3	Using machine learning technology, a SVM model was created to predict target efficiency for any given gRNAs.

G06.2	self driving	2906897310	G06.2_2906897310_1	A key problem for autonomous car navigation is the understanding, at an object level, of the current driving situation.
G06.2	self driving	2906897310	G06.2_2906897310_2	Addressing this issue requires the extraction of meaningful information from on-board stereo imagery by classifying the fundamental elements of urban scenes into semantic categories that can more easily be interpreted and be reflected upon (streets, buildings, pedestrians, vehicles, signs, etc.).
G06.2	self driving	2906897310	G06.2_2906897310_3	A probabilistic method is proposed to fuse a coarse prior 3D map data with stereo imagery classification.
G06.2	self driving	2906897310	G06.2_2906897310_4	A novel fusion architecture based on the Stixel framework is presented for combining semantic pixel-wise segmentation from a convolutional neural network (CNN) with depth information obtained from stereo imagery while integrating coarse prior depth and label information.
G06.2	self driving	2906897310	G06.2_2906897310_5	The proposed approach was tested on a manually labeled data set in urban environments.
G06.2	self driving	2906897310	G06.2_2906897310_6	The results show that the classification accuracy of the fundamental elements composing the urban scene was significantly enhanced by this method compared to what is obtained from the semantic pixel-wise segmentation of a CNN alone.
G06.2	self driving	2968176166	G06.2_2968176166_1	In recent years self-driving vehicles have become more commonplace on public roads, with the promise of bringing safety and efficiency to modern transportation systems.
G06.2	self driving	2968176166	G06.2_2968176166_2	Increasing the reliability of these vehicles on the road requires an extensive suite of software tests, ideally performed on highfidelity simulators, where multiple vehicles and pedestrians interact with the self-driving vehicle.
G06.2	self driving	2968176166	G06.2_2968176166_3	It is therefore of critical importance to ensure that self-driving software is assessed against a wide range of challenging simulated driving scenarios.
G06.2	self driving	2968176166	G06.2_2968176166_4	The state of the art in driving scenario generation, as adopted by some of the front-runners of the self-driving car industry, still relies on human input [1].
G06.2	self driving	2968176166	G06.2_2968176166_5	In this paper we propose to automate the process using Bayesian optimization to generate adversarial self-driving scenarios that expose poorly-engineered or poorly-trained self-driving policies, and increase the risk of collision with simulated pedestrians and vehicles.
G06.2	self driving	2968176166	G06.2_2968176166_6	We show that by incorporating the generated scenarios into the training set of the self-driving policy, and by fine-tuning the policy using vision-based imitation learning we obtain safer self-driving behavior.
G06.2	self driving	2958092349	G06.2_2958092349_1	With the developing of the technology on self-driving, more and more L3 driverless vehicles are launched in market, people get opportunities to experience the self-driving cars in their daily life.
G06.2	self driving	2958092349	G06.2_2958092349_2	As a result, there is a growing demand for the autopilot experience.
G06.2	self driving	2958092349	G06.2_2958092349_3	Natural and efficient human-computer interaction can not only improve the driving experience, but also accelerate the process of self-driving commercialization.
G06.2	self driving	2958092349	G06.2_2958092349_4	This paper discusses eye-movement interaction, voice interaction and gesture interaction in self-driving car, and analyzes the technology, advantages and disadvantages of the existing interaction modes, and prospect the future development trend of self-driving human-computer interaction.
G06.2	self driving	2606555570	G06.2_2606555570_1	Self-driving vehicle technologies are progressing rapidly and are expected to play a significant role in the future of transportation.
G06.2	self driving	2606555570	G06.2_2606555570_2	One of the main challenges for self-driving vehicles on public roads is the safe cooperation and collaboration among multiple vehicles using sensor-based perception and inter-vehicle communications.
G06.2	self driving	2606555570	G06.2_2606555570_3	When self-driving vehicles try to occupy the same spatial area simultaneously, they might collide with one another, might become deadlocked, or might slam on the brakes making it uncomfortable or unsafe for passengers in a self-driving vehicle.
G06.2	self driving	2606555570	G06.2_2606555570_4	In this paper, we study how a self-driving vehicle can safely navigate merge points, where two lanes with different priorities meet.
G06.2	self driving	2606555570	G06.2_2606555570_5	We present a safe protocol for merge points named Autonomous Vehicle Protocol for Merge Points, where self-driving vehicles use both vehicular communications and their own perception systems for cooperating with other self-driving and/or human-driven vehicles.
G06.2	self driving	2606555570	G06.2_2606555570_6	Our simulation results show that our traffic protocol has higher traffic throughput, compared to simple traffic protocols, while ensuring safety.
G06.2	self driving	2548923997	G06.2_2548923997_1	Emerging self-driving vehicles are vulnerable to different attacks due to the principle and the type of communication systems that are used in these vehicles.
G06.2	self driving	2548923997	G06.2_2548923997_2	These vehicles are increasingly relying on external communication via vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs).
G06.2	self driving	2548923997	G06.2_2548923997_3	VANETs add new threats to self-driving vehicles that contribute to substantial challenges in autonomous systems.
G06.2	self driving	2548923997	G06.2_2548923997_4	These communication systems render self-driving vehicles vulnerable to many types of malicious attacks, such as Sybil attacks, Denial of Service (DoS), black hole, grey hole and wormhole attacks.
G06.2	self driving	2548923997	G06.2_2548923997_5	In this paper, we propose an intelligent security system designed to secure external communications for self-driving and semi self-driving cars.
G06.2	self driving	2548923997	G06.2_2548923997_6	The hybrid detection system relies on the Back Propagation neural networks (BP), to detect a common type of attack in VANETs: Denial-of-Service (DoS).
G06.2	self driving	2548923997	G06.2_2548923997_7	The experimental results show that the proposed BP-IDS is capable of identifying malicious vehicles in self-driving and semi self-driving vehicles.
G06.2	self driving	2931522054	G06.2_2931522054_1	This paper proposes a MATLAB/Simulink benchmark suite for an open-source self-driving system based on Robot Operating System (ROS).
G06.2	self driving	2931522054	G06.2_2931522054_2	One approach to the development of self-driving systems is the utilization of ROS which is an open-source middleware framework used in the development of robot applications.
G06.2	self driving	2931522054	G06.2_2931522054_3	On the other hand, the popular approach in the automotive industry is the utilization of MATLAB/Simulink which is software for modeling, simulating, and analyzing.
G06.2	self driving	2931522054	G06.2_2931522054_4	MATLAB/Simulink provides an interface between ROS and MATLAB/Simulink that enables to create functionalities of ROS-based robots in MATLAB/Simulink.
G06.2	self driving	2931522054	G06.2_2931522054_5	However, it is not been fully utilized in the development of self-driving systems yet because there are not enough samples for self-driving, and it is difficult for developers to adopt co-development.
G06.2	self driving	2931522054	G06.2_2931522054_6	Therefore, we provide a MATLAB/Simulink benchmark suite for a ROS-based self-driving system called Autoware.
G06.2	self driving	2931522054	G06.2_2931522054_7	Autoware is popular open-source software that provides a complete set of self-driving modules.
G06.2	self driving	2931522054	G06.2_2931522054_8	The provided benchmark contains MATLAB/Simulink samples available in Autoware.
G06.2	self driving	2931522054	G06.2_2931522054_9	They help to design ROS-based self-driving systems using MATLAB/Simulink.
G06.2	self driving	2954032282	G06.2_2954032282_1	Ensuring the safety of self-driving cars is important, but neither industry nor authorities have settled on a standard way to test them.
G06.2	self driving	2954032282	G06.2_2954032282_2	Deploying self-driving cars for testing in regular traffic is a common, but costly and risky method, which has already caused fatalities.
G06.2	self driving	2954032282	G06.2_2954032282_3	As a safer alternative, virtual tests, in which self-driving car software is tested in computer simulations, have been proposed.
G06.2	self driving	2954032282	G06.2_2954032282_4	One cannot hope to sufficiently cover the huge number of possible driving situations self-driving cars must be tested for by manually creating such tests.
G06.2	self driving	2954032282	G06.2_2954032282_5	Therefore, we developed AsFault, a tool for automatically generating virtual tests for systematically testing self-driving car software.
G06.2	self driving	2954032282	G06.2_2954032282_6	We demonstrate AsFault by testing the lane keeping feature of an artificial intelligence-based self-driving car software, for which AsFault generates scenarios that cause it to drive off the road.
G06.2	self driving	2954032282	G06.2_2954032282_7	A video illustrating AsFault in action is available at: https://youtu.be/lJ1sa42VLDw
G06.2	self driving	2982382045	G06.2_2982382045_1	At the brink of the introduction of self-driving vehicles, only little is known about how potential users perceive them.
G06.2	self driving	2982382045	G06.2_2982382045_2	This is especially true for self-driving vehicles deployed in public transport services.
G06.2	self driving	2982382045	G06.2_2982382045_3	In this study, the relative preferences for a trip with a self-driving bus is assessed compared to a trip with a regular bus, based on a stated preference experiment.
G06.2	self driving	2982382045	G06.2_2982382045_4	Based on the responses of 282 respondents from the Netherlands and Germany, a discrete choice model is estimated as a Mixed Logit model including attitudes towards trust in self-driving vehicles and interest in technology.
G06.2	self driving	2982382045	G06.2_2982382045_5	The results show that currently public transport passengers prefer the self-driving bus over the regular bus only for short trips.
G06.2	self driving	2982382045	G06.2_2982382045_6	This is due to the finding that the value of travel time is about twice as high for the self-driving bus as for the regular bus for a short commuting trip.
G06.2	self driving	2982382045	G06.2_2982382045_7	Findings from this study further suggest that the popularity of self-driving busses decreases with the presence of a human steward on-board, or if they are operated as a demand-responsive service with fixed routes.
G06.2	self driving	2982382045	G06.2_2982382045_8	People who currently show a strong interest in technology or trust in automated vehicle technology perceive the self-driving busses better than others.
G06.2	self driving	2982382045	G06.2_2982382045_9	Preferences towards automated public transport services are expected to evolve along with the transition from demonstration pilots to their deployment in regular operations.
G06.2	self driving	2935172463	G06.2_2935172463_1	The management of self-driving systems is becoming more complex as the development of self-driving technology progresses.
G06.2	self driving	2935172463	G06.2_2935172463_2	One approach to the development of self-driving systems is the use of ROS; however, the system used in the automotive industry is typically designed using MATLAB/Simulink, which can simulate and evaluate the models used for self-driving.
G06.2	self driving	2935172463	G06.2_2935172463_3	These models are incompatible with ROS-based systems.
G06.2	self driving	2935172463	G06.2_2935172463_4	To allow the two to be used in tandem, it is necessary to rewrite the C++ code and incorporate them into the ROS-based system, which makes development inefficient.
G06.2	self driving	2935172463	G06.2_2935172463_5	Therefore, the proposed framework allows models created using MATLAB/Simulink to be used in a ROS-based self-driving system, thereby improving development efficiency.
G06.2	self driving	2935172463	G06.2_2935172463_6	Furthermore, our evaluations of the proposed framework demonstrated its practical potential.
G07.1	misinformation	2239526842	G07.1_2239526842_1	Online Social Networks OSNs have become increasingly popular means of information sharing among users.
G07.1	misinformation	2239526842	G07.1_2239526842_2	The spread of news regarding emergency events is common in OSNs and so is the spread of misinformation related to the event.
G07.1	misinformation	2239526842	G07.1_2239526842_3	We define as misinformation any false or inaccurate information that is spread either intentionally or unintentionally.
G07.1	misinformation	2239526842	G07.1_2239526842_4	In this paper we study the problem of misinformation identification in OSNs, and we focus in particular on the Twitter social network.
G07.1	misinformation	2239526842	G07.1_2239526842_5	Based on user and tweets characteristics, we build a misinformation detection model that identifies suspicious behavioral patterns and exploits supervised learning techniques to detect misinformation.
G07.1	misinformation	2239526842	G07.1_2239526842_6	Our extensive experimental results on 80294 unique tweets and 59660 users illustrate that our approach effectively identifies misinformation during emergencies.
G07.1	misinformation	2239526842	G07.1_2239526842_7	Furthermore, our model manages to timely identify misinformation, a feature that can be used to limit the spread of the misinformation.
G07.1	misinformation	2894304194	G07.1_2894304194_1	Superintelligence is a potential type of future artificial intelligence (AI) that is significantly more intelligent than humans in all major respects.
G07.1	misinformation	2894304194	G07.1_2894304194_2	If built, superintelligence could be a transformative event, with potential consequences that are massively beneficial or catastrophic.
G07.1	misinformation	2894304194	G07.1_2894304194_3	Meanwhile, the prospect of superintelligence is the subject of major ongoing debate, which includes a significant amount of misinformation.
G07.1	misinformation	2894304194	G07.1_2894304194_4	Superintelligence misinformation is potentially dangerous, ultimately leading bad decisions by the would-be developers of superintelligence and those who influence them.
G07.1	misinformation	2894304194	G07.1_2894304194_5	This paper surveys strategies to counter superintelligence misinformation.
G07.1	misinformation	2894304194	G07.1_2894304194_6	Two types of strategies are examined: strategies to prevent the spread of superintelligence misinformation and strategies to correct it after it has spread.
G07.1	misinformation	2894304194	G07.1_2894304194_7	In general, misinformation can be difficult to correct, suggesting a high value of strategies to prevent it.
G07.1	misinformation	2894304194	G07.1_2894304194_8	The strategies proposed can be applied to lay public attention to superintelligence, AI education programs, and efforts to build expert consensus.
G07.1	misinformation	2950010073	G07.1_2950010073_1	The widespread online misinformation could cause public panic and serious economic damages.
G07.1	misinformation	2950010073	G07.1_2950010073_2	The misinformation containment problem aims at limiting the spread of misinformation in online social networks by launching competing campaigns.
G07.1	misinformation	2950010073	G07.1_2950010073_3	Motivated by realistic scenarios, we present the first analysis of the misinformation containment problem for the case when an arbitrary number of cascades are allowed.
G07.1	misinformation	2950010073	G07.1_2950010073_4	First, we provide a formal model for multi-cascade diffusion and introduce an important concept called as cascade priority.
G07.1	misinformation	2950010073	G07.1_2950010073_5	Second, we show that the misinformation containment problem cannot be approximated within a factor of $\\Omega(2^{\\log^{1-\\epsilon}n^4})$ in polynomial time unless $NP \\subseteq DTIME(n^{\\polylog{n}})$.
G07.1	misinformation	2950010073	G07.1_2950010073_6	Third, we introduce several types of cascade priority that are frequently seen in real social networks.
G07.1	misinformation	2950010073	G07.1_2950010073_7	Finally, we design novel algorithms for solving the misinformation containment problem.
G07.1	misinformation	2950010073	G07.1_2950010073_8	The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is supported by encouraging experimental results.
G07.1	misinformation	2100028027	G07.1_2100028027_1	Inaccurate information, in the field of library and information science, is often regarded as a problem that needs to be corrected or simply understood as either misinformation or disinformation without further consideration.
G07.1	misinformation	2100028027	G07.1_2100028027_2	Misinformation and disinformation, however, may cause significant problems for users in online environments, where they are constantly exposed to an abundance of inaccurate and/or misleading information.
G07.1	misinformation	2100028027	G07.1_2100028027_3	This paper aims to establish conceptual groundwork for future empirical research by examining the relationships among information, misinformation, and disinformation.
G07.1	misinformation	2100028027	G07.1_2100028027_4	Our analysis extends to a discussion of cues to deception, as means for detecting misinformation and disinformation.
G07.1	misinformation	2100028027	G07.1_2100028027_5	We argue that misinformation and disinformation are related yet distinct sub-categories of information.
G07.1	misinformation	2100028027	G07.1_2100028027_6	Misinformation is a multifaceted concept, more complex than simply being inaccurate or incomplete, and disinformation does not always entail misinformation.
G07.1	misinformation	2111507945	G07.1_2111507945_1	The growth of social media provides a convenient communication scheme for people, but at the same time it becomes a hotbed of misinformation.
G07.1	misinformation	2111507945	G07.1_2111507945_2	The wide spread of misinformation over social media is injurious to public interest.
G07.1	misinformation	2111507945	G07.1_2111507945_3	We design a framework, which integrates collective intelligence and machine intelligence, to help identify misinformation.
G07.1	misinformation	2111507945	G07.1_2111507945_4	The basic idea is: (1) automatically index the expertise of users according to their microblog contents; and (2) match the experts with given suspected misinformation.
G07.1	misinformation	2111507945	G07.1_2111507945_5	By sending the suspected misinformation to appropriate experts, we can collect the assessments of experts to judge the credibility of information, and help refute misinformation.
G07.1	misinformation	2111507945	G07.1_2111507945_6	In this paper, we focus on expert finding for misinformation identification.
G07.1	misinformation	2111507945	G07.1_2111507945_7	We propose a tag-based method to index the expertise of microblog users with social tags.
G07.1	misinformation	2111507945	G07.1_2111507945_8	Experiments on a real world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for expert finding with respect to misinformation identification in microblogs.
G07.1	misinformation	2124690797	G07.1_2124690797_1	The importance of research on misinformation has received wide recognition.
G07.1	misinformation	2124690797	G07.1_2124690797_2	Two major challenges faced by this research community are the lack of theoretical models and the scarcity of misinformation in support of such research.
G07.1	misinformation	2124690797	G07.1_2124690797_3	This paper aims to address the aforementioned challenges by conceptualizing misinformation and enabling the interoperability of misinformation.
G07.1	misinformation	2124690797	G07.1_2124690797_4	In particular, a representation and a model of misinformation are proposed through surveying, synthesizing, and explicating existing work in the field.
G07.1	misinformation	2124690797	G07.1_2124690797_5	The ontology-supported misinformation model can not only guide future misinformation research but also lay the foundation for building a digital misinformation library by advancing our knowledge on misinformation and by improving its sharing, management, and reuse.
G07.1	misinformation	2124690797	G07.1_2124690797_6	In addition, we present a formal methodology for managing misinformation in a digital library, and suggest future research directions related to the misinformation model.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2773680786	G07.2_2773680786_1	Conspiracy theories have gained much academic and media attention recently, due to their large impact on public events.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2773680786	G07.2_2773680786_2	However, little is known about how conspiracy theories are produced and developed on social media.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2773680786	G07.2_2773680786_3	We present a qualitative study of conspiracy theorizing on Reddit during a public health crisis--the Zika virus outbreak.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2773680786	G07.2_2773680786_4	Using a mixed-methods approach including content analysis and discourse analysis, we identified types of conspiracy theories that appeared on Reddit in response to the Zika crisis, the conditions under which Zika conspiracy theories emerge, and the particular discursive strategies through which Zika conspiracy theories developed in online forums.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2773680786	G07.2_2773680786_5	Our analysis shows that conspiracy talk emerged as people attempted to make sense of a public health crisis, reflecting their emergent information needs and their pervasive distrust in formal sources of Zika information.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2773680786	G07.2_2773680786_6	Practical implications for social computing researchers, health practitioners, and policymakers are discussed.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2899514909	G07.2_2899514909_1	Conspiracy theories are omnipresent in online discussions---whether to explain a late-breaking event that still lacks official report or to give voice to political dissent.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2899514909	G07.2_2899514909_2	Conspiracy theories evolve, multiply, and interconnect, further complicating efforts to understand them and to limit their propagation.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2899514909	G07.2_2899514909_3	It is therefore crucial to develop scalable methods to examine the nature of conspiratorial discussions in online communities.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2899514909	G07.2_2899514909_4	What do users talk about when they discuss conspiracy theories online? What are the recurring elements in their discussions? What do these elements tell us about the way users think? This work answers these questions by analyzing over ten years of discussions in r/conspiracy---an online community on Reddit dedicated to conspiratorial discussions.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2899514909	G07.2_2899514909_5	We focus on the key elements of a conspiracy theory: the conspiratorial agents, the actions they perform, and their targets.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2899514909	G07.2_2899514909_6	"For example, a narrative-motif such as \""governmental agency-controls-communications\"" represents the various ways in which multiple conspiratorial statements denote how governmental agencies control information."
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2899514909	G07.2_2899514909_7	Thus, narrative-motifs expose commonalities between multiple conspiracy theories even when they refer to different events or circumstances.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2899514909	G07.2_2899514909_8	In the process, these representations help us understand how users talk about conspiracy theories and offer us a means to interpret what they talk about.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2899514909	G07.2_2899514909_9	Our approach enables a population-scale study of conspiracy theories in alternative news and social media with implications for understanding their adoption and combating their spread.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2749521565	G07.2_2749521565_1	Yet contemporary work in Philosophy argues provisional belief in conspiracy theories is—at the very—least understandable (because conspiracies occur) and if we take an evidential approach—judging individual conspiracy theories on their particular merits—belief in such theories turns out to be warranted in a range of cases.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2749521565	G07.2_2749521565_2	Drawing on this work, I examine the kinds of evidence typically associated with conspiracy theories, showing that the evidential problems typically associated with conspiracy theories are not unique to such theories.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2749521565	G07.2_2749521565_3	As such, if there is a problem with the conspiracy theorist’s use of evidence, it is one of principle: is the principle which guides their use of evidence somehow in error? I argue that whatever we might think about conspiracy theories generally, there is no prima facie case for a scepticism of conspiracy theories based purely on their use of evidence.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2907181942	G08.1_2907181942_1	Cryptocurrency is a rapid developing financial technology innovation which has attracted a large number of people around the world.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2907181942	G08.1_2907181942_2	The high-speed evolution, radical price fluctuations of cryptocurrency, and the inconsistent attitudes of monetary authorities in different countries have triggered panic and chain reactions towards the application and adoption of cryptocurrency and have caused public security related events.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2907181942	G08.1_2907181942_3	In this paper, we analyze the dynamics and systemic risk of the cryptocurrency market based on the public available price history.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2907181942	G08.1_2907181942_4	Furthermore, consistent with public perception, our quantitative analysis reveals that the cryptocurrency market is relatively fragile and unstable.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2806518684	G08.1_2806518684_1	Blockchain technology is the underlying enabling technology developed for Bitcoin, the most common cryptocurrency.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2806518684	G08.1_2806518684_2	Blockchain technologies have become increasingly popular with the potential to become a powerful disruptive force.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2806518684	G08.1_2806518684_3	Individuals and organizations may benefit from blockchain with its ability to increase secure data exchange and to make that transaction simpler and easier between entities.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2806518684	G08.1_2806518684_4	We investigate factors that influence an individualu0027s intention to use a blockchain cryptocurrency.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2806518684	G08.1_2806518684_5	We develop a model of cryptocurrency adoption grounded in the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to: identify the determinants for the acceptance of cryptocurrency and explore the relative importance of each construct.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2806518684	G08.1_2806518684_6	We offer empirical evidence for a better theoretical understanding of cryptocurrency adoption with practical implications in an e-government context.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2972302621	G08.1_2972302621_1	Cryptocurrency was built initially as a possible implementation of digital currency, then various derivatives were created in a variety of fields such as financial transactions, capital management, and even nonmonetary applications.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2972302621	G08.1_2972302621_2	This paper aims to offer analytical insights to help understand cryptocurrency by treating it as a financial asset.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2972302621	G08.1_2972302621_3	We position cryptocurrency by comparing its dynamic characteristics with two traditional and massively adopted financial assets: foreign exchange and stock.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2972302621	G08.1_2972302621_4	Our investigation suggests that the dynamics of cryptocurrency are more similar to stock.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2972302621	G08.1_2972302621_5	As to the robustness and clustering structure, our analysis shows cryptocurrency market is more fragile than stock market, thus it is currently a high-risk financial market.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	3004077497	G08.1_3004077497_1	The smart device owning rate such as smart phone and smart watch is higher than ever before and mobile payment has become one of the major payment methods in many different areas.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	3004077497	G08.1_3004077497_2	At the same time, blockchain-based cryptocurrency is becoming a nonnegligible type of currency and the total value of all types of cryptocurrency has reached USD 200 billion.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	3004077497	G08.1_3004077497_3	Therefore, it is a natural demand to support cryptocurrency payment on mobile devices.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	3004077497	G08.1_3004077497_4	Considering the poor infrastructure and low penetration of financial service in developing countries, this combination is especially attractive.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	3004077497	G08.1_3004077497_5	The high storage cost and payment processing latency are the two main obstacles for mobile payment using cryptocurrency.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	3004077497	G08.1_3004077497_6	We propose two different schemes for cryptocurrency mobile payment, one involves a centralized bank and the other one does not require any centralized party.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	3004077497	G08.1_3004077497_7	We also provide a solution for the bank to meet KYC (know your customer)/AML (antimoney laundering) compliance requirements when it is involved in cryptocurrency mobile payment processing.
G08.2	financial markets	1607424157	G08.2_1607424157_1	Motivated by recent financial crises significant research efforts have been put into studying contagion effects and herding behaviour in financial markets.
G08.2	financial markets	1607424157	G08.2_1607424157_2	Much less has been said about influence of financial news on financial markets.
G08.2	financial markets	1607424157	G08.2_1607424157_3	We propose a novel measure of collective behaviour in financial news on the Web, News Cohesiveness Index (NCI), and show that it can be used as a systemic risk indicator.
G08.2	financial markets	1607424157	G08.2_1607424157_4	We evaluate the NCI on financial documents from large Web news sources on a daily basis from October 2011 to July 2013 and analyse the interplay between financial markets and financially related news.
G08.2	financial markets	1607424157	G08.2_1607424157_5	We hypothesized that strong cohesion in financial news reflects movements in the financial markets.
G08.2	financial markets	1607424157	G08.2_1607424157_6	Cohesiveness is more general and robust measure of systemic risk expressed in news, than measures based on simple occurrences of specific terms.
G08.2	financial markets	1607424157	G08.2_1607424157_7	Our results indicate that cohesiveness in the financial news is highly correlated with and driven by volatility on the financial markets.
G08.2	financial markets	2807531787	G08.2_2807531787_1	In this paper, I propose a methodology to study the comovement between the entropy of different financial markets.
G08.2	financial markets	2807531787	G08.2_2807531787_2	The entropy is derived using singular value decomposition of the components of stock market indices in financial markets from selected developed economies, i.e., France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
G08.2	financial markets	2807531787	G08.2_2807531787_3	I study how a shock in the entropy in the United States affects the entropy in the other financial markets.
G08.2	financial markets	2807531787	G08.2_2807531787_4	I also model the entropy using a dynamic factor model and derive a common factor behind the entropy movements in these four markets.
G09.1	forensics	2202800066	G09.1_2202800066_1	Mobile devices are very common in everyone’s day-to- day life.
G09.1	forensics	2202800066	G09.1_2202800066_2	Nowadays such devices come with many features of desktop or laptop.
G09.1	forensics	2202800066	G09.1_2202800066_3	Hence people can use these devices for diverse applications.
G09.1	forensics	2202800066	G09.1_2202800066_4	As the acceptability and usability of such devices are very high, there are chances that these devices can be used for illegal activities.
G09.1	forensics	2202800066	G09.1_2202800066_5	The percentage of mobile phones or smart phones involved in cyber crimes is in hike.
G09.1	forensics	2202800066	G09.1_2202800066_6	So it becomes necessary to digitally analyze such devices requiring cyber forensics tools.
G09.1	forensics	2202800066	G09.1_2202800066_7	This paper discusses different types of digital evidence present in Microsoft’s Windows Mobile smart phones and an agent based approach for logically acquiring such devices.
G09.1	forensics	2202800066	G09.1_2202800066_8	Also it describes a tool developed for forensically acquiring and analyzing Windows Mobile devices and WinCE PDAs.
G09.1	forensics	2921035272	G09.1_2921035272_1	The increasing prevalence of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has made it inevitable that their pertinence to digital forensic investigations will increase into the foreseeable future.
G09.1	forensics	2921035272	G09.1_2921035272_2	These devices produced by various vendors often posses limited standard interfaces for communication, such as USB ports or WiFi/Bluetooth wireless interfaces.
G09.1	forensics	2921035272	G09.1_2921035272_3	Meanwhile, with an increasing mainstream focus on the security and privacy of user data, built-in encryption is becoming commonplace in consumer-level computing devices, and IoT devices are no exception.
G09.1	forensics	2921035272	G09.1_2921035272_4	Under these circumstances, a significant challenge is presented to digital forensic investigations where data from IoT devices needs to be analysed.
G09.1	forensics	2921035272	G09.1_2921035272_5	This work explores the electromagnetic (EM) side-channel analysis literature for the purpose of assisting digital forensic investigations on IoT devices.
G09.1	forensics	2921035272	G09.1_2921035272_6	EM side-channel analysis is a technique where unintentional electromagnetic emissions are used for eavesdropping on the operations and data handling of computing devices.
G09.1	forensics	2921035272	G09.1_2921035272_7	The non-intrusive nature of EM side-channel approaches makes it a viable option to assist digital forensic investigations as these attacks require, and must result in, no modification to the target device.
G09.1	forensics	2921035272	G09.1_2921035272_8	The literature on various EM side-channel analysis attack techniques are discussed – selected on the basis of their applicability in IoT device investigation scenarios.
G09.1	forensics	2921035272	G09.1_2921035272_9	The insight gained from the background study is used to identify promising future applications of the technique for digital forensic analysis on IoT devices – potentially progressing a wide variety of currently hindered digital investigations.
G09.1	forensics	1965213295	G09.1_1965213295_1	The use of mobile phone forensics to investigate fraudulent activity is nothing new.
G09.1	forensics	1965213295	G09.1_1965213295_2	But mobile phones have evolved into smartphones, and fraudsters have evolved with them.
G09.1	forensics	1965213295	G09.1_1965213295_3	Smartphones are packed with functionality that can easily be used for data theft or inappropriate contact with other parties - none of which passes through company-owned systems, and is to all intents and purposes 'off the grid'.
G09.1	forensics	1965213295	G09.1_1965213295_4	Employers need to be aware of these risks when devices are issued, along with ensuring that processes are in place when suspicions are raised, explains Philip Ridley of CCL-Forensics.
G09.1	forensics	1965213295	G09.1_1965213295_5	Detecting 'tech-savvy' corporate fraudsters is a constant game of catch-up.
G09.1	forensics	1965213295	G09.1_1965213295_6	It's not only about playing catch-up with the intellect, motives and awareness of the e-fraudster, but also the technologies that can be misused.
G09.1	forensics	1965213295	G09.1_1965213295_7	What's more, the methods through which the technology can be manipulated to secrete, disguise and protect fraudulent activities - all while staying away from corporate networks where they can readily be monitored and detected - are constantly evolving.
G09.1	forensics	1965213295	G09.1_1965213295_8	This means a company's intellectual property and sensitive data is at risk of sabotage or just good old-fashioned theft.

G07.2	conspiracy theories	170316166	G07.2_170316166_7	Moreover, we measure the effect of 4709 evidently false information (satirical version of conspiracist stories) and 4502 debunking memes (information aiming at contrasting unsubstantiated rumors) on polarized users of conspiracy claims.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	1887815499	G07.2_1887815499_1	We propose a novel approach framed in terms of information theory and entropy to tackle the issue of the propagation of conspiracy theories.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	1887815499	G07.2_1887815499_2	We represent the initial report of an event (such as the 9/11 terroristic attack) as a series of strings of information, each string classified by a two-state variable Ei = ±1, i = 1, …, N. If the values of the Ei are set to −1 for all strings, a state of minimum entropy is achieved.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	1887815499	G07.2_1887815499_3	Comments on the report, focusing repeatedly on several strings Ek, might alternate their meaning (from −1 to +1).
G07.2	conspiracy theories	1887815499	G07.2_1887815499_4	The representation of the event is turned fuzzy with an increased entropy value.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	1887815499	G07.2_1887815499_5	Beyond some threshold value of entropy, chosen by simplicity to its maximum value, meaning N/2 variables with Ei = 1, the chance is created that a conspiracy theory might be initiated/propagated.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	1887815499	G07.2_1887815499_6	Therefore, the evolution of the associated entropy is a way to measure the degree of penetration of a conspiracy theory.

T16.2	guessing attack	2010327684	T16.2_2010327684_3	However, Ku, Chen, and Lee pointed out that their scheme can not resist an off-line guessing attack, a denial-of-service attack, and a stolen-verifier attack.

T16.2	guessing attack	2063867724	T16.2_2063867724_2	This study shows that the password-based multi-server authentication scheme proposed by Yeh and Lo is vulnerable to undetectable password-guessing attack and offline password-guessing attack.
T16.2	guessing attack	2063867724	T16.2_2063867724_3	This study proposes a new password-based multi-server authentication scheme to overcome these vulnerabilities.
T16.2	guessing attack	2063867724	T16.2_2063867724_4	The proposed protocol introduces a new mechanism for protecting user password.
T16.2	guessing attack	2063867724	T16.2_2063867724_5	The RC sends an alternative key to help the server verify the legitimacy of user instead of the user's password.

T16.2	guessing attack	2784826804	T16.2_2784826804_2	Since the smart card is used for securing transaction, then security issue in the smart card becomes important.

G02.1		2173753523	G02.1_2173753523_7	According to our experimental results, each reconstructed confidential image which does turn out to look like the original confidential image through our human visual system and its PSNR is greater than 34 dB for 256 gray level images.
G02.2		1496406490	G02.2_1496406490_1	Identities and profiles are important to enable e-commerce transactions.
G02.2		1496406490	G02.2_1496406490_2	Recent initiatives, like Microsoft .My Services and Liberty Alliance Project, aim at the provision of identity and profile management solutions along with mechanisms to simplify usersu0027 experience.
G02.2		1496406490	G02.2_1496406490_3	These solutions must be trusted and accountable.
G02.2		1496406490	G02.2_1496406490_4	Current PKI solutions can be used to deal with certification and trust management.
G02.2		1496406490	G02.2_1496406490_5	Unfortunately the complexity of managing digital credential lifecycle is one of the obstacles to their adoption.
G02.2		1496406490	G02.2_1496406490_6	This complexity is accentuated in the case of dynamic environments, where the certified information is subject to frequent changes.
G02.2		1496406490	G02.2_1496406490_7	In this paper we address the problem of providing up-to-date certified information in dynamic contexts.
G02.2		1496406490	G02.2_1496406490_8	We introduce the concept of active digital credential as a mechanism to provide up-to-date certified identity and profile information along with a fine-grained assessment of trustworthiness and validity.
G02.2		1496406490	G02.2_1496406490_9	Work is in progress both to implement a prototype and assess the feasibility of the proposed model.
G02.2		2122915930	G02.2_2122915930_1	By offering personalized content to users, recommender systems have become a vital tool in e-commerce and online media applications.
G02.2		2122915930	G02.2_2122915930_2	Content-based algorithms recommend items or products to users, that are most similar to those previously purchased or consumed.
G02.2		2122915930	G02.2_2122915930_3	Unfortunately, collecting and storing ratings, on which content-based methods rely, also poses a serious privacy risk for the customers: ratings may be very personal or revealing, and thus highly privacy sensitive.
G02.2		2122915930	G02.2_2122915930_4	Service providers could process the collected rating data for other purposes, sell them to third parties or fail to provide adequate physical security.
G02.2		2122915930	G02.2_2122915930_5	In this paper, we propose technological mechanisms to protect the privacy of individuals in a recommender system.
G02.2		2122915930	G02.2_2122915930_6	Our proposal is founded on homomorphic encryption, which is used to obscure the private rating information of the customers from the service provider.
G02.2		2122915930	G02.2_2122915930_7	While the useru0027s privacy is respected by the service provider, by generating recommendations using encrypted customer ratings, the service provideru0027s commercially valuable item-item similarities are protected against curious entities, in turn.
G02.2		2122915930	G02.2_2122915930_8	Our proposal explores simple and efficient cryptographic techniques to generate private recommendations using a server-client model, which neither relies on (trusted) third parties, nor requires interaction with peer users.
G02.2		2122915930	G02.2_2122915930_9	The main strength of our contribution lies in providing a highly efficient solution without resorting to unrealistic assumptions.
G02.2		2406834167	G02.2_2406834167_1	Several recent studies have demonstrated that people show large behavioural uniqueness.
G02.2		2406834167	G02.2_2406834167_2	This has serious privacy implications as most individuals become increasingly re-identifiable in large datasets or can be tracked while they are browsing the web using only a couple of their attributes, called as their fingerprints.
G02.2		2406834167	G02.2_2406834167_3	Often, the success of these attacks depend on explicit constraints on the number of attributes learnable about individuals, i.e., the size of their fingerprints.
G02.2		2406834167	G02.2_2406834167_4	These constraints can be budget as well as technical constraints imposed by the data holder.
G02.2		2406834167	G02.2_2406834167_5	For instance, Apple restricts the number of applications that can be called by another application on iOS in order to mitigate the potential privacy threats of leaking the list of installed applications on a device.
G02.2		2406834167	G02.2_2406834167_6	In this work, we address the problem of identifying the attributes (e.g., smartphone applications) that can serve as a fingerprint of users given constraints on the size of the fingerprint.
G02.2		2406834167	G02.2_2406834167_7	We give the best fingerprinting algorithms in general, and evaluate their effectiveness on several real-world datasets.
G02.2		2406834167	G02.2_2406834167_8	Our results show that current privacy guards limiting the number of attributes that can be queried about individuals is insufficient to mitigate their potential privacy risks in many practical cases.
G04.1		2102726567	G04.1_2102726567_1	Virtual screening of a large chemical library for drug lead identification requires searching/superimposing a large number of three-dimensional (3D) chemical structures.
G04.1		2102726567	G04.1_2102726567_2	This article reports a graphic processing unit (GPU)-accelerated weighted Gaussian algorithm (gWEGA) that expedites shape or shape-feature similarity score-based virtual screening.
G04.1		2102726567	G04.1_2102726567_3	With 86 GPU nodes (each node has one GPU card), gWEGA can screen 110 million conformations derived from an entire ZINC drug-like database with diverse antidiabetic agents as query structures within 2 s (i.e., screening more than 55 million conformations per second).
G04.1		2102726567	G04.1_2102726567_4	The rapid screening speed was accomplished through the massive parallelization on multiple GPU nodes and rapid prescreening of 3D structures (based on their shape descriptors and pharmacophore feature compositions).

G04.1		2268932570	G04.1_2268932570_1	Summary: Identifying chemical probes or seeking scaffolds for a specific biological target is important for protein function studies.
G04.1		2268932570	G04.1_2268932570_2	Therefore, we create the Annotated Scaffold Database (ASDB), a computer-readable and systematic target-annotated scaffold database, to serve such needs.
G04.1		2268932570	G04.1_2268932570_3	The scaffolds in ASDB were derived from public databases including ChEMBL, DrugBank and TCMSP, with a scaffold-based classification approach.
G04.1		2268932570	G04.1_2268932570_4	Each scaffold was assigned with an InChIKey as its unique identifier, energy-minimized 3D conformations, and other calculated properties.
G04.1		2268932570	G04.1_2268932570_5	A scaffold is also associated with drugs, natural products, drug targets and medical indications.
G04.1		2268932570	G04.1_2268932570_6	The database can be retrieved through text or structure query tools.
G04.1		2268932570	G04.1_2268932570_7	ASDB collects 333 601 scaffolds, which are associated with 4368 targets.
G04.1		2268932570	G04.1_2268932570_8	The scaffolds consist of 3032 scaffolds derived from drugs and 5163 scaffolds derived from natural products.
G04.1		2268932570	G04.1_2268932570_9	For given scaffolds, scaffold-target networks can be generated from the database to demonstrate the relations of scaffolds and targets.
G04.1		2268932570	G04.1_2268932570_10	Availability and implementation: ASDB is freely available at http://www.rcdd.org.cn/asdb/with the major web browsers.

G04.1		2137690465	G04.1_2137690465_1	Druggable Protein–protein Interaction Assessment System (Dr. PIAS) is a database of druggable protein–protein interactions (PPIs) predicted by our support vector machine (SVM)-based method.
G04.1		2137690465	G04.1_2137690465_2	Since the first publication of this database, Dr. PIAS has been updated to version 2.0.
G04.1		2137690465	G04.1_2137690465_3	PPI data have been increased considerably, from 71 500 to 83 324 entries.
G04.1		2137690465	G04.1_2137690465_4	As the new positive instances in our method, 4 PPIs and 10 tertiary structures have been added.
G04.1		2137690465	G04.1_2137690465_5	This addition increases the prediction accuracy of our SVM classifier in comparison with the previous classifier, despite the number of added PPIs and structures is small.
G04.1		2137690465	G04.1_2137690465_6	We have introduced the novel concept of ‘similar positives’ of druggable PPIs, which will help researchers discover small compounds that can inhibit predicted druggable PPIs.
G04.1		2137690465	G04.1_2137690465_7	Dr. PIAS will aid the effective search for druggable PPIs from a mine of interactome data being rapidly accumulated.

G04.2		1981844148	G04.2_1981844148_1	One of the main challenges in protein-protein docking is a meaningful evaluation of the many putative solutions.
G04.2		1981844148	G04.2_1981844148_2	Here we present a program (PROCOS) that calculates a probability-like measure to be native for a given complex.
G04.2		1981844148	G04.2_1981844148_3	In contrast to scores often used for analyzing complex structures, the calculated probabilities offer the advantage of providing a fixed range of expected values.
G04.2		1981844148	G04.2_1981844148_4	This will allow, in principle, the comparison of models corresponding to different targets that were solved with the same algorithm.
G04.2		1981844148	G04.2_1981844148_5	Judgments are based on distributions of properties derived from a large database of native and false complexes.
G04.2		1981844148	G04.2_1981844148_6	For complex analysis PROCOS uses these property distributions of native and false complexes together with a support vector machine (SVM).
G04.2		1981844148	G04.2_1981844148_7	PROCOS was compared to the established scoring schemes of ZRANK and DFIRE.
G04.2		1981844148	G04.2_1981844148_8	Employing a set of experimentally solved native complexes, high probability values above 50% were obtained for 90% of these structures.
G04.2		1981844148	G04.2_1981844148_9	Next, the performance of PROCOS was tested on the 40 binary targets of the Dockground decoy set, on 14 targets of the RosettaDock decoy set and on 9 targets that participated in the CAPRI scoring evaluation.
G04.2		1981844148	G04.2_1981844148_10	Again the advantage of using a probability-based scoring system becomes apparent and a reasonable number of near native complexes was found within the top ranked complexes.
G04.2		1981844148	G04.2_1981844148_11	In conclusion, a novel fully automated method is presented that allows the reliable evaluation of protein-protein complexes.
G04.2		2072768184	G04.2_2072768184_1	The Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP) has produced a large number of gene expression patterns, many of which have been annotated textually with anatomical and developmental terms.
G04.2		2072768184	G04.2_2072768184_2	These terms spatially correspond to local regions of the images; however, they are attached collectively to groups of images, such that it is unknown which term is assigned to which region of which image in the group.
G04.2		2072768184	G04.2_2072768184_3	This poses a challenge to the development of the computational method to automate the textual description of expression patterns contained in each image.
G04.2		2072768184	G04.2_2072768184_4	In this paper, we show that the underlying nature of this task matches well with a new machine learning framework, Multi-Instance Multi-Label learning (MIML).
G04.2		2072768184	G04.2_2072768184_5	We propose a new MIML support vector machine to solve the problems that beset the annotation task.
G04.2		2072768184	G04.2_2072768184_6	Empirical study shows that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art Drosophila gene expression pattern annotation methods.
G04.3		1519137304	G04.3_1519137304_1	With the growing threat of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, which spread more easily and quickly worldwide resulted from the globalization, it is necessary to be capable to forecast significant changes of infectious diseases for emergency preparation purpose.
G04.3		1519137304	G04.3_1519137304_2	Foresight China Project aims at exploring a new method by identifying the drivers of infectious diseases and predicting the trends of these drivers.
G04.3		1523076482	G04.3_1523076482_1	The next-generation model outlined in the AMIA Roadmap for National Action on Clinical Decision Support (CDS) is aimed to optimize the effectiveness of CDS interventions, and to achieve widespread adoption.
G04.3		1523076482	G04.3_1523076482_2	BJC HealthCare re-engineered its existing CDS system in alignment with the AMIA roadmap and plans to use it for guidance on further enhancements.
G04.3		1523076482	G04.3_1523076482_3	We present our experience and discuss an incremental approach to migrate towards the next generation of CDS applications from the viewpoint of a healthcare institution.
G04.3		1523076482	G04.3_1523076482_4	Specifically, a CDS rule engine service with a standards-based rule representation format was built to simplify maintenance and deployment.
G04.3		1523076482	G04.3_1523076482_5	Rules were separated from execution code and made customizable for multi-facility deployment.
G04.3		1523076482	G04.3_1523076482_6	Those changes resulted in system improvements in the short term while aligning with long-term strategic objectives.
G06.2		2886776222	G06.2_2886776222_1	The paper describes an investigation into the public opinion about self-driving vehicles among Dutch people.
G06.2		2886776222	G06.2_2886776222_2	New in our approach is to design a questionnaire on the basis of different theories of acceptance of new technology in organisations and society in combinations with additional questions about specific factors such as the economic implications of self-driving vehicle services.
G06.2		2886776222	G06.2_2886776222_3	As results, we present a predictive model of public opinion about self-driving cars that evaluates the relevant factors and which shows the feasibility of a theory-based approach to design survey tools.
G07.1		2012336753	G07.1_2012336753_1	The World Wide Web is a potentially powerful channel for misinformation.
G07.1		2012336753	G07.1_2012336753_2	Focusing upon scholarly misconduct as a source of misinformation, examines the potential impact of misinformation on the Web.
G07.1		2012336753	G07.1_2012336753_3	Floridi has suggested three methods of countering misinformation on the Web: quality certification of information sources; limiting monopolies controlling information resources on the Web; and greater information literacy among Web users.
G07.1		2012336753	G07.1_2012336753_4	Focus groups composed of LIS faculty and research students in Singapore discussed this topic.
G07.1		2012336753	G07.1_2012336753_5	Members of the groups felt that there was sufficient motivation for trying to publish the results of scholarly misconduct on the Web.
G07.1		2012336753	G07.1_2012336753_6	Group members agreed that greater information literacy was a good way to counter misinformation.
G07.1		2012336753	G07.1_2012336753_7	They did not believe that quality certification would stop misinformation, and that there was a danger that a certifying group would become a censoring body.
G07.1		2012336753	G07.1_2012336753_8	Focus group members said that greater plurality would decrease misinformation.
G07.1		2012336753	G07.1_2012336753_9	Some argued that large and prestigious publishers should be welcomed on to the Web rather than opposed.
G07.1		2025749534	G07.1_2025749534_1	This paper examines the relationship between misinformation about product quality and quality standards, such as minimum quality standards (MQSs) and certification criteria, when products are vertically differentiated in terms of their health/safety aspects.
G07.1		2025749534	G07.1_2025749534_2	We investigate the welfare effect of regulating misinformation and strengthening MQSs.
G07.1		2025749534	G07.1_2025749534_3	We find that the welfare effect of a decrease in misinformation crucially depends on the existing amount of misinformation; moreover, a more stringent MQS either improves or deteriorates welfare.
G07.1		2025749534	G07.1_2025749534_4	Two effects figure strongly throughout our results.
G07.1		2025749534	G07.1_2025749534_5	First, changes in misinformation and/or an MQS make price competition between firms more or less serious, causing changes in price and quantity.
G07.1		2025749534	G07.1_2025749534_6	Second, these changes influence some consumers’ choices, leading them to change the products that they purchase.
G07.1		2025749534	G07.1_2025749534_7	This change in consumption behavior increases or decreases inappropriate choices when misinformation is present.
G07.1		2025749534	G07.1_2025749534_8	We extend the analysis to the case in which a high-quality firm’s quality investment is endogenously determined.
G08.1		2999674664	G08.1_2999674664_1	Cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies have developed in parallel in recent years, with technological breakthroughs in currency issuance, payment methods, and currency storage.
G08.1		2999674664	G08.1_2999674664_2	However, the existing cryptocurrencies cannot replace fiat money.
G08.1		2999674664	G08.1_2999674664_3	There is a huge gap between decentralized cryptocurrency and central bank digital currency, namely CBDC, in terms of monetary governance and circulation.
G08.1		2999674664	G08.1_2999674664_4	In this paper, we propose the function and security requirements of CBDC, through a comprehensive analysis of the existing typical cryptocurrency and the prototype of the CBDC scheme.
G08.1		2999674664	G08.1_2999674664_5	On this basis, we present a blockchain-based framework for CBDC with three layers, including supervisory layer, network layer and user layer, and describe the key business processes of the CBDCu0027s entire lifecycle of issuance-circulation-withdrawal in detail.
G08.1		2999674664	G08.1_2999674664_6	Finally, we take cross-border payment as an example to explain the transaction process of CBDC.
G08.1		2999674664	G08.1_2999674664_7	We aim to provide theoretical guidance for CBDC design.
G08.2		2053103247	G08.2_2053103247_1	Financial markets are primarily driven by three key drivers, technologies, competition and globalization.
G08.2		2053103247	G08.2_2053103247_2	These drivers are accompanied with challenging risks.
G08.2		2053103247	G08.2_2053103247_3	Market authorities monitor activities in order to reduce to the barest minimum the adverse impacts some products and services have on the whole financial system.
G08.2		2053103247	G08.2_2053103247_4	This indicates the need for a high quality monitoring and surveillance system.
G08.2		2053103247	G08.2_2053103247_5	This paper examines financial markets as service systems that jointly create value to stakeholders.
G08.2		2053103247	G08.2_2053103247_6	It proposes a framework for the design of financial market monitoring system based on the concept of service dominant logic, service science and systems thinking.
G08.2		2053103247	G08.2_2053103247_7	Finally, it identifies a number of properties that need to be examined in financial markets service systems.
G09.1		1977415353	G09.1_1977415353_1	In this paper, we present our reverse engineering results for the Zeus crimeware toolkit which is one of the recent and powerful crimeware tools that emerged in the Internet underground community to control botnets.
G09.1		1977415353	G09.1_1977415353_2	Zeus has reportedly infected over 3.6 million computers in the United States.
G09.1		1977415353	G09.1_1977415353_3	Our analysis aims at uncovering the various obfuscation levels and shedding the light on the resulting code.
G09.1		1977415353	G09.1_1977415353_4	Accordingly, we explain the bot building and installation/infection processes.
G09.1		1977415353	G09.1_1977415353_5	In addition, we detail a method to extract the encryption key from the malware binary and use that to decrypt the network communications and the botnet configuration information.
G09.1		1977415353	G09.1_1977415353_6	The reverse engineering insights, together with network traffic analysis, allow for a better understanding of the technologies and behaviors of such modern HTTP botnet crimeware toolkits and opens an opportunity to inject falsified information into the botnet communications which can be used to defame this crimeware toolkit.
G09.1		1971766706	G09.1_1971766706_1	Abstract   Virtualization is a technology that uses a logical environment to overcome physical limitations in hardware.
G09.1		1971766706	G09.1_1971766706_2	Recently, its coverage has become broader.
G09.1		1971766706	G09.1_1971766706_3	Because a virtual machine can perform the same role as an actual system, a recorded user’s activity trail in the virtual machine is important factor in terms of digital forensics.
G09.1		1971766706	G09.1_1971766706_4	If the investigator found trails of the VMware Workstation on the host, he should investigate the virtual machine along with host system.
G09.1		1971766706	G09.1_1971766706_5	However, due to a lack of understanding of the virtual machine, the investigation process is not clear.
G09.1		1971766706	G09.1_1971766706_6	Moreover, a damaged virtual machine image is difficult to investigate because of the structural characteristics.
G09.1		1971766706	G09.1_1971766706_7	Therefore, we need a technical understanding and a research about investigation procedures and recovery methods on the virtual machine.
G09.1		1971766706	G09.1_1971766706_8	In this research, we suggest an investigation procedure of digital forensics and a recovery method on damaged images for the VMware Workstation that has the largest number of users.
G09.1		1940252083	G09.1_1940252083_1	Citadel is an advanced information stealing malware that targets financial information.
G09.1		1940252083	G09.1_1940252083_2	This malware poses a real threat against the confidentiality and integrity of personal and business data.
G09.1		1940252083	G09.1_1940252083_3	Recently, a joint operation has been conducted by FBI and Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit in order to take down Citadel command-and-control servers.
G09.1		1940252083	G09.1_1940252083_4	The operation caused some disruption in the botnet but has not stopped it completely.
G09.1		1940252083	G09.1_1940252083_5	Due to the complex structure and advanced anti-reverse engineering techniques, the Citadel malware analysis process is challenging and time-consuming.
G09.1		1940252083	G09.1_1940252083_6	This allows cyber criminals to carry on with their attacks while the analysis is still in progress.
G09.1		1940252083	G09.1_1940252083_7	In this paper, we present the results of the Citadel reverse engineering and provide additional insights into the functionality, inner workings, and open source components of the malware.
G09.1		1940252083	G09.1_1940252083_8	In order to accelerate the reverse engineering process, we propose a clone-based analysis methodology.
G09.1		1940252083	G09.1_1940252083_9	Citadel is an offspring of a previously analyzed malware called Zeus.
G09.1		1940252083	G09.1_1940252083_10	Thus, using the former as a reference, we can measure and quantify the similarities and differences of the new variant.
G09.1		1940252083	G09.1_1940252083_11	Two types of code analysis techniques are provided in the methodology namely assembly to source code matching, and binary clone detection.
G09.1		1940252083	G09.1_1940252083_12	The methodology can help reduce the number of functions that should be analyzed manually.
G09.1		1940252083	G09.1_1940252083_13	The analysis results prove that the approach is promising in Citadel malware analysis.
G09.1		1940252083	G09.1_1940252083_14	Furthermore, the same approach is applicable to similar malware analysis scenarios.
G09.1		2981809794	G09.1_2981809794_1	In this paper, we reviewed the scientific literature of digital forensics between 1990 to 2019.
G09.1		2981809794	G09.1_2981809794_2	The visualized charts of keyword cloud, surging keywords and co-citation networks were generated by CiteSpace V. Based on the analysis, it was found that: (1) the research contents of digital forensics are focused on eight aspects.
G09.1		2981809794	G09.1_2981809794_3	They are basic theory and methods, physical equipment and forensic methods, image forgery identification, file recovery and data extraction, smart phones and social network forensics, case-based forensics and crime forensics, automatic identification technology and tools, cloud computing and cloud forensics.
G09.1		2981809794	G09.1_2981809794_4	(2) The research evolutional paths were followed by storage media, image forensics technologies, data recovery technologies, encryption and decryption technologies, human and social characteristics.
G09.1		2981809794	G09.1_2981809794_5	(3) The breakthrough of image forgery identification technology accelerated the development of digital forensics; smart phone and social network forensics and automated forensics technologies bring important paradigm shift; in the future, automatic forensics and cloud forensics will be hot research directions.
G09.1		2845881471	G09.1_2845881471_1	As one of the main technologies supporting cloud computing virtualization, Docker is featured in its fast and lightweight virtualization which has been adopted by numerous platform-as-a-service (PaaS) systems, but forensics research for Docker has not been paid the corresponding attention yet.
G09.1		2845881471	G09.1_2845881471_2	Docker exists to store and distribute illegal information as a carrier for initiating attacks like traditional cloud services.
G09.1		2845881471	G09.1_2845881471_3	The paper explains Docker service principles and structural features, and analyzing the model and method of forensics in related cloud environment, then proposes a Docker container forensics solution based on the Docker API.
G09.1		2845881471	G09.1_2845881471_4	In this paper, Docker APIs realize the derivation of the Docker container instances, copying and back-up of the container data volume, extraction of the key evidence data, such as container log information, configuration information and image information, thus conducts localized fixed forensics to volatile evidence and data in the Docker service container.
G09.1		2845881471	G09.1_2845881471_5	Combined with digital signatures and digital encryption technology to achieve the integrity of the original evidence data protection.
G10.1		2909327212	G10.1_2909327212_1	In this paper, we present a visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system for humanoid robots.
G10.1		2909327212	G10.1_2909327212_2	We introduce a new binary descriptor called DLab that exploits the combined information of color, depth, and intensity to achieve robustness with respect to uniqueness, reproducibility, and stability.
G10.1		2909327212	G10.1_2909327212_3	We use DLab within ORB-SLAM, where we replaced the place recognition module with a modification of FAB-MAP that works with newly built codebooks using our binary descriptor.
G10.1		2909327212	G10.1_2909327212_4	In experiments carried out in simulation and with a real Nao humanoid equipped with an RGB-D camera, we show that DLab has a superior performance in comparison to other descriptors.
G10.1		2909327212	G10.1_2909327212_5	The application to feature tracking and place recognition reveal that the new descriptor is able to reliably track features even in sequences with seriously blurred images and that it has a higher percentage of correctly identified similar images.
G10.1		2909327212	G10.1_2909327212_6	As a result, our new visual SLAM system has a lower absolute trajectory error in comparison to ORB-SLAM and is able to accurately track the robotu0027s trajectory.

G15.1	snowden	2294193098	G15.1_2294193098_1	Prior to the NSA affair [1], the threat to electronic enterprise communication was considered to be beyond the firewall.
G15.1	snowden	2294193098	G15.1_2294193098_2	With the Snowden revelations[2] however and the increased use of mobile devices for business email, the need to secure communication from sender to recipient and within the corporate network has raised the awareness[3] for industrial scale end-to-end encryption.
G15.1	snowden	192930805	G15.1_192930805_1	Information provided by whistleblower Edward Snowden imposingly demonstrated the advanced capabilities of intelligence agencies, especially the National Security Agency (NSA), to monitor Internet usage on a large scale.
G15.1	snowden	192930805	G15.1_192930805_2	Huge amounts of data are collected day by day, violating the privacy of millions of people.
G15.1	snowden	192930805	G15.1_192930805_3	Public media suggest that IT security methods like encryption are the magic bullet to protect one’s privacy.
G15.1	snowden	192930805	G15.1_192930805_4	This paper reflects on the feasibility and practical limitations of technical privacy protection.
G15.1	snowden	192930805	G15.1_192930805_5	Current vulnerabilities of widely used IT security mechanisms impressively demonstrate the limitations of these mechanisms.
G15.1	snowden	2786217712	G15.1_2786217712_1	Legislation surrounding digital privacy has seen quite an upheaval in recent years.
G15.1	snowden	2786217712	G15.1_2786217712_2	The introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU, and new resolutions within the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) have recognized the urgency to include recommendations on the use of encryption to protect the digital identities of citizens.
G15.1	snowden	2786217712	G15.1_2786217712_3	In this work, we meander through the main events in history which have shaped the legislative landscape that encompasses the use of encryption, paying particular attention to recent (post-Snowden) developments.
G15.1	snowden	1563336151	G15.1_1563336151_1	The functionality of the Internet and the World Wide Web is determined in large part by the standards that allow for interoperable implementations, as a result, the privacy of our online interactions depends on the work done within standard-setting organizations.

G15.2	cookies	2098473270	G15.2_2098473270_3	In addition, stolen cookies may also incur severe security problems.
G15.2	cookies	2098473270	G15.2_2098473270_4	However, current Web browsers lack secure and convenient mechanisms for cookie management.
G15.2	cookies	2098473270	G15.2_2098473270_5	A cookie management scheme, which is easy-to-use and has minimal privacy risk, is in great demand; but designing such a scheme is a challenge.
G15.2	cookies	2098473270	G15.2_2098473270_6	In this paper, we conduct a large scale HTTP cookie measurement and introduce CookiePicker, a system that can automatically validate the usefulness of cookies from a Web site and set the cookie usage permission on behalf of users.
G15.2	cookies	2098473270	G15.2_2098473270_7	CookiePicker helps users achieve the maximum benefit brought by cookies, while minimizing the possible privacy and security risks.

G15.2	cookies	2105783544	G15.2_2105783544_1	Many large Internet websites are accessed by users anonymously, without requiring registration or logging-in.
G15.2	cookies	2105783544	G15.2_2105783544_2	However, to provide personalized service these sites build anonymous, yet persistent, user models based on repeated user visits.
G15.2	cookies	2105783544	G15.2_2105783544_3	Cookies, issued when a web browser first visits a site, are typically employed to anonymously associate a website visit with a distinct user (web browser).
G15.2	cookies	2105783544	G15.2_2105783544_4	However, users may reset cookies, making such association short-lived and noisy.
G15.2	cookies	2105783544	G15.2_2105783544_5	In this paper we propose a solution to the cookie churn problem: a novel algorithm for grouping similar cookies into clusters that are more persistent than individual cookies.
G15.2	cookies	2105783544	G15.2_2105783544_6	Such clustering could potentially allow more robust estimation of the number of unique visitors of the site over a certain long time period, and also better user modeling which is key to plenty of web applications such as advertising and recommender systems.
G15.2	cookies	2105783544	G15.2_2105783544_7	We present a novel method to cluster browser cookies into groups that are likely to belong to the same browser based on a statistical model of browser visitation patterns.
G15.2	cookies	2105783544	G15.2_2105783544_8	We address each step of the clustering as a binary classification problem estimating the probability that two different subsets of cookies belong to the same browser.
G15.2	cookies	2105783544	G15.2_2105783544_9	We observe that our clustering problem is a generalized interval graph coloring problem, and propose a greedy heuristic algorithm for solving it.
G15.2	cookies	2105783544	G15.2_2105783544_10	The scalability of this method allows us to cluster hundreds of millions of browser cookies and provides significant improvements over baselines such as constrained K-means.

G15.3	gdpr	3006740491	G15.3_3006740491_1	GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is a new regulation of the European Union that superimposes strict privacy constraints on storing, accessing and processing user data, as a way to ensure that personal user data are not violated neither disclosed without an explicit consent.
G15.3	gdpr	3006740491	G15.3_3006740491_2	As a consequence, business processes that interact with large amounts of such data may easily cause GDPR violations, due to the typical complexity of such processes.
G15.3	gdpr	3006740491	G15.3_3006740491_3	Inspired by these considerations, this paper highlights the challenges and critical aspects associated with the GDPR compliance journey when opting for naive straight-forward solutions.
G15.3	gdpr	3006740491	G15.3_3006740491_4	We propose a business-aware GDPR compliance journey using online process mining.
G15.3	gdpr	3006740491	G15.3_3006740491_5	Using several large log files generated based on a real scenario, we show that the proposed tool is both effective and efficient.
G15.3	gdpr	3006740491	G15.3_3006740491_6	As such, it proves to be a powerful concept for usage in incremental GDPR compliance environments.
G15.3	gdpr	2946108943	G15.3_2946108943_1	In an increasingly digital world, where processing and exchange of personal data are key parts of everyday enterprise business processes (BPs), the right to data privacy is regulated and actively enforced in the Europe Union (EU) through the recently introduced General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), whose aim is to protect EU citizens from privacy breaches.
G15.3	gdpr	2946108943	G15.3_2946108943_2	In this direction, GDPR is highly influencing the way organizations must approach data privacy, forcing them to rethink and upgrade their BPs in order to become GDPR compliant.
G15.3	gdpr	2946108943	G15.3_2946108943_3	For many organizations, this can be a daunting task, since little has been done so far to easily identify privacy issues in BPs.
G15.3	gdpr	2946108943	G15.3_2946108943_4	To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we provide an analysis of the main privacy constraints in GDPR and propose a set of design patterns to capturing and integrating such constraints in BP models.
G15.3	gdpr	2946108943	G15.3_2946108943_5	Using BPMN (Business Process Modeling Notation) as modeling notation, our approach allows us to achieve full transparency of privacy constraints in BPs making it possible to ensure their compliance with GDPR.

G16.1	algorithm	2092575453	G16.1_2092575453_3	We provide a solution for the high level of availability of business processes by the use of cluster of enterprise service buses (ESB).
G16.1	algorithm	2092575453	G16.1_2092575453_4	Our approach is based on the dynamic creation of the route between the business services and the migration of a runtime context from one ESB to another one.
G16.1	algorithm	2092575453	G16.1_2092575453_5	So, we insure the management of business processes over a cluster and measure the impact of such incident.

G16.2	nlp applications	2518696416	G16.2_2518696416_1	Semantic similarity measures between linguistic terms are essential in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications.
G16.2	nlp applications	2518696416	G16.2_2518696416_2	Term similarity is most conventionally perceived as a symmetric relation.
G16.2	nlp applications	2518696416	G16.2_2518696416_3	However, semantic directional (asymmetric) relations exist in lexical semantics and make symmetric similarity measures less suitable for their identification.
G16.2	nlp applications	2518696416	G16.2_2518696416_4	Furthermore, directional similarity actually represents even more general conditions and is more practical in some specific NLP applications than symmetric similarity.
G16.2	nlp applications	2518696416	G16.2_2518696416_5	As the footstone of similarity measures, current semantic features cannot efficiently represent large scale web text collections.
G16.2	nlp applications	2518696416	G16.2_2518696416_6	Hence, we propose a new directional similarity method, considering feature representations both in linguistic and extra linguistic dimensions.
G16.2	nlp applications	2518696416	G16.2_2518696416_7	We evaluate our approach on standard word similarity, reporting state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.
G16.2	nlp applications	2518696416	G16.2_2518696416_8	Experiments show that our directional method handles both symmetric and directional semantic relations and leads to clear improvements in entity search and query expansion.

T16.2	guessing attack	2010710834	T16.2_2010710834_5	Chen et al.’s scheme is also vulnerable to an off-line password guessing attack and an undetectable on-line password guessing attack when user’s smart card is stolen.
T16.2	guessing attack	2010710834	T16.2_2010710834_6	In server side, Chen et al.’s scheme needs large computational load to authentication a legal user or reject an illegal user.
T16.2	guessing attack	2010710834	T16.2_2010710834_7	To remedy the weaknesses in Chen et al.’s scheme, we propose an improved smart card based password authentication scheme.
T16.2	guessing attack	2010710834	T16.2_2010710834_8	Our analysis shows that the improved scheme can overcome the weaknesses in Chen et al.’s scheme.
T16.2	guessing attack	2087734433	T16.2_2087734433_1	With the increased use of encryption in business, key recovery has emerged as a critical issue to users.
T16.2	guessing attack	2087734433	T16.2_2087734433_2	As encryption is deployed to protect files and network communications, users must include safeguards that prevent the inadvertent loss of data and use of the network for malicious intent.
T16.2	guessing attack	2087734433	T16.2_2087734433_3	This paper explains what key recovery is, presents a refined practical model of a key recovery scheme and describes a new key recovery scheme compliant with this model.
T16.2	guessing attack	2087734433	T16.2_2087734433_4	A novel feature of this key recovery scheme is that it is resistant to online guessing attack.
T16.2	guessing attack	2087734433	T16.2_2087734433_5	Most of key recovery schemes used today are able to detect online guessing attack but not able to prevent it.
T16.2	guessing attack	2087734433	T16.2_2087734433_6	Consequently, users face the problem of denial of service which occurs when key recovery server shuts down the service to legitimate users though temporarily as a security measure.
T16.2	guessing attack	2087734433	T16.2_2087734433_7	Key recovery server also, often ask users to change password which was attacked causing further inconvenience.
T16.2	guessing attack	2087734433	T16.2_2087734433_8	So, a security solution Captcha is employed in this new key recovery scheme to make it secure against online guessing attack.
T17.4	key generation	2072049844	T17.4_2072049844_1	Although smart cards are becoming used in an increasing number of applications, there is small literature of the implementation issues for smart cards.
T17.4	key generation	2072049844	T17.4_2072049844_2	This paper describes the issues and considerations that need to be taken into account when implementing the key generation step of a cryptographic algorithm widely used nowadays, RSA.Smart cards are used in many applications that require a tamper resistant area.
T17.4	key generation	2072049844	T17.4_2072049844_3	Therefore, smart cards that use cryptography have to provide encryption, decryption, as well as key generation inside its security perimeter.
T17.4	key generation	2072049844	T17.4_2072049844_4	RSA key generation is a concern for on-card implementation of RSA cryptosystem, as it usually takes a long time.
T17.4	key generation	2072049844	T17.4_2072049844_5	In this paper, two simple but efficient key generation algorithms are evaluated, in addition to a simple but not very efficient algorithm.
T17.4	key generation	2072049844	T17.4_2072049844_6	The paper discusses in detail how to build fast implementations for the three algorithms presented, using smart cards with crypto-coprocessor.
T18.1	backscatter	2088429605	T18.1_2088429605_1	Passive, backscatter radio frequency identification (RFID) systems are often range limited by the power incident on the radio frequency (RF) tag.
T18.1	backscatter	2088429605	T18.1_2088429605_2	We have demonstrated an increase in the power incident on the RF tag using transmit diversity in a monostatic backscatter channel.
T18.1	backscatter	2088429605	T18.1_2088429605_3	Transmit diversity was achieved by phase conjugating the forward link of the backscatter channel associated with each reader antenna.
T18.1	backscatter	2088429605	T18.1_2088429605_4	The resulting increase in incident power will increase the range of passive backscatter systems and improve performance in fading environments.
T19.1	traffic optimization	2114867054	T19.1_2114867054_1	Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) have recently gained wide attention as a way to provide Internet connectivity in hard-to-reach areas as well as in big cities.
T19.1	traffic optimization	2114867054	T19.1_2114867054_2	The main problem of such networks is their limited bandwidth availability compared to wired networks.
T19.1	traffic optimization	2114867054	T19.1_2114867054_3	Hence, efficient usage of available communication resources is of crucial importance for WMNs.
T19.1	traffic optimization	2114867054	T19.1_2114867054_4	Peer-to-peer applications, these days, produce a considerable amount of traffic over the Internet.
T19.1	traffic optimization	2114867054	T19.1_2114867054_5	Such applications build their own overlay network by not taking into account the topology and the status of the underlying infrastructure, so causing an inefficient utilization of physical communication resources.
T19.1	traffic optimization	2114867054	T19.1_2114867054_6	This problem is particularly severe for Wireless Mesh Networks.
T19.1	traffic optimization	2114867054	T19.1_2114867054_7	In this paper we propose a cross-layer solution for P2P Bittorrent traffic optimization in WMNs, based on the ALTO (Application Layer Traffic Optimization) Service recently defined by the IETF.
T19.1	traffic optimization	2114867054	T19.1_2114867054_8	Our solution is able to significantly optimize Bittorrent traffic and it does not require any modification to the Bittorrent application.
T19.1	traffic optimization	2114867054	T19.1_2114867054_9	The tests we performed show a reduction of about 27% of download time and a reduction of about 66% of traffic crossing the WMN borders.
T19.2	genetic algorithm	2511808037	T19.2_2511808037_1	Software testing is one of the most inevitable processes in software development.
T19.2	genetic algorithm	2511808037	T19.2_2511808037_2	The field of software testing has seen an extensive use of search based techniques in the last decade.
T19.2	genetic algorithm	2511808037	T19.2_2511808037_3	Among the search based techniques, it is the metaheuristic techniques such as genetic algorithm that has garnered the major share of attention from researchers.
T19.2	genetic algorithm	2511808037	T19.2_2511808037_4	Looking at the large body of work that has happened and is happening in this field, we feel that it is high time someone studied how well genetic algorithm based techniques fare in practical testing process.
T19.2	genetic algorithm	2511808037	T19.2_2511808037_5	Method: In this work, we present a roadmap to the future of genetic algorithm based software testing, based on a review of literature.
T19.2	genetic algorithm	2511808037	T19.2_2511808037_6	We have mainly reviewed the works which use genetic algorithm for software test data generation.
T19.2	genetic algorithm	2511808037	T19.2_2511808037_7	This independent review is designed to direct the attention of future researchers to the deficiencies of genetic algorithm based testing, their possible solutions and the extent to which they are correctable.
T19.2	genetic algorithm	2511808037	T19.2_2511808037_8	The observations from the selected primary studies highlight the issues faced when genetic algorithm is applied in software testing.
T19.2	genetic algorithm	2511808037	T19.2_2511808037_9	The observations form the review reveal that the type of genetic algorithm used, fitness function design, population initialization and parameter settings does impact the quality of solution obtained in software testing using genetic algorithm.
T19.2	genetic algorithm	2511808037	T19.2_2511808037_10	From the review we conclude that, more generalized approaches can make genetic algorithm based software testing one of the strongest methods in practical software testing.
T19.2	genetic algorithm	2511808037	T19.2_2511808037_11	We hope that, this review will be a major breakthrough in genetic algorithm based software testing field.
T19.2	genetic algorithm	2199032957	T19.2_2199032957_1	This paper focuses on accuracy and robustness of parameters inversion in probability integral method by genetic algorithm.
T19.2	genetic algorithm	2199032957	T19.2_2199032957_2	For this, uniform design experimental method, subsidence prediction software and genetic algorithm program are used.
T19.2	genetic algorithm	2199032957	T19.2_2199032957_3	Result shows that parameters in probability integral method can be retrieved precisely by genetic algorithm with relative errors of the retrieved parameters are less than 1.5%; retrieving parameters by genetic algorithm has a great applicability in different areas such as measuring errors, gross errors, loss of observation stations, etc.
T19.3	road accident	2027512737	T19.3_2027512737_1	Abstract Road accident analysis is not new.
T19.3	road accident	2027512737	T19.3_2027512737_2	It has come to attention as traffic fatalities had an explosive increase in the 50u0027s and 60u0027s, especially in the industrialized world and during the intense period of economic growth.
T19.3	road accident	2027512737	T19.3_2027512737_3	This paper examines the potential use of the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology in facilitating road accident analysis in Hong Kong.
T19.3	road accident	2027512737	T19.3_2027512737_4	Various point-pattern techniques are illustrated.
T19.3	road accident	2027512737	T19.3_2027512737_5	While GIS can extend the visualization and analytical capabilities, its implementation in Hong Kong would hinge upon more comprehensive planning in data acquisition and integration.
T19.3	road accident	2027512737	T19.3_2027512737_6	A master digital database on road systems of Hong Kong with a standardized structure and coherent naming conventions in both Chinese and English is fundamental to further GIS development in the area of road accident analysis.

G05.2	crispr	2161871693	G05.2_2161871693_1	Summary: Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based technologies have revolutionized human genome engineering and opened countless possibilities to basic science, synthetic biology and gene therapy.
G05.2	crispr	2161871693	G05.2_2161871693_2	Albeit the enormous potential of these tools, their performance is far from perfect.
G05.2	crispr	2161871693	G05.2_2161871693_3	It is essential to perform a posterior careful analysis of the gene editing experiment.

G05.2	crispr	2770474929	G05.2_2770474929_1	The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a creative and innovative gene editing biotechnology tool in genetic engineering.
G05.2	crispr	2770474929	G05.2_2770474929_2	Although several achievements have been attained using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, it is still a challenge to avoid off-target effects and improve the editing efficacy.
G05.2	crispr	2770474929	G05.2_2770474929_3	Previous efforts on evaluating the efficacy and designing the guide RNA mainly focused on DNA properties.
G05.2	crispr	2770474929	G05.2_2770474929_4	However, some DNA features have not been characterized but can be reflected by protein properties, such as the disorder features and the sequence conservation.
G05.2	crispr	2770474929	G05.2_2770474929_5	In this paper, we provided a computational framework to identify important features related to the efficacy of CRISPR/Cas9 focusing on the properties of the proteins encoded by the target DNA fragments.
G05.2	crispr	2770474929	G05.2_2770474929_6	The feature selection method, maximal-relevance-minimal-redundancy, was adopted to analyze these features.
G05.2	crispr	2770474929	G05.2_2770474929_7	And incremental feature selection together with support vector machine, were employed to extract optimal features, on which an optimal classifier can be constructed.
G05.2	crispr	2770474929	G05.2_2770474929_8	As a result, 152 important features were extracted, with which an optimal classifier based on support vector machine was built.
G05.2	crispr	2770474929	G05.2_2770474929_9	This classifier obtained the highest MCC value of 0.355.
G05.2	crispr	2770474929	G05.2_2770474929_10	Finally, a series of detailed biological analyses were performed on the optimal features.
G05.2	crispr	2770474929	G05.2_2770474929_11	From the results, we found that some key factors may differentially affect the binding activity of sgRNAs to their targets.
G05.2	crispr	2770474929	G05.2_2770474929_12	Among them, the disorder status of the target protein sequences was found to be a major factor that is related to the efficacy of sgRNAs, suggesting the DNA features associated with the protein disorder status could also affect the CRISPR/Cas9 efficacy.
G05.2	crispr	2888304237	G05.2_2888304237_1	" :[0],""of hits from independent CRISPR or siRNA screens is poor."
G05.2	crispr	2888304237	G05.2_2888304237_2	This is partly due to data normalization primarily addressing technical variability within independent screens, and not the technical differences between them.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2804740007	G07.2_2804740007_1	Fake news has become a major societal issue and a technical chal- lenge for social media companies to identify.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2804740007	G07.2_2804740007_2	"This content is dif- cult to identify because the term ""fake news"" covers intention- ally false, deceptive stories as well as factual errors, satire, and sometimes, stories that a person just does not like."
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2804740007	G07.2_2804740007_3	Addressing the problem requires clear de nitions and examples.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2804740007	G07.2_2804740007_4	In this work, we present a dataset of fake news and satire stories that are hand coded, veri ed, and, in the case of fake news, include rebutting stories.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2804740007	G07.2_2804740007_5	We also include a thematic content analysis of the articles, identifying major themes that include hyperbolic support or con- demnation of a gure, conspiracy theories, racist themes, and dis- crediting of reliable sources.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2804740007	G07.2_2804740007_6	In addition to releasing this dataset for research use, we analyze it and show results based on language that are promising for classi cation purposes.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2804740007	G07.2_2804740007_7	Overall, our contri- bution of a dataset and initial analysis are designed to support fu- ture work by fake news researchers.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_1	We are told the Web is different from previous mass communication technologies because its technical affordances have created an informational “Wild West” (Reevell (2007)).
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_2	We are also told, that by overestimating their ‘savvy’, we have abandoned many young people to the risks of this frontier beyond regulation (Hargittai, 2010) (boyd, 2014) (Livingstone, 2007).
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_3	Young people are therefore said to be vulnerable to untruths circulating on the Web such as health misinformation (Levin-Zamir, Lemish, u0026 Gofin, 2011) (Hargittai u0026 Young, 2012) and conspiracy theories (Millar, 2012).
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_4	The advertised remedy for these problem populations of digitally illiterate youths is a programme of re-education.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_5	I begin by examining these claims to show the way we have constructed and investigated this problem has shaped our claims about young people online.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_6	I argue, in our drive to locate problem populations, we have reduced young people’s relationship with the Web to a series of reductive summative judgments that blame the Web or young people for their lack of digital information literacy.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_7	If we accept the current orthodoxy and then blame the Web we offer a technological determinist explanation of reality: technology produces misinformed populations.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_8	If we locate the problem solely with young people, as many researchers do, we evoke a legacy of bio-physiological conceptions of youth’s deficiencies.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_9	Our social explanations often attribute young people’s deficiencies to their parent’s occupation (the typical proxy in this research domain for socio-economic status) or their ethnicity; but these reduce young people to unreflective victims of structural inequality.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_10	I begin by conceptually distancing my research from positivistic methods such as tests and questionnaires that often confirm young people’s relatively powerless position in society (Morrow u0026 Richards, 1996); particularly when these methods result in binary judgments such as ‘unskilled’ or ‘skilled’.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_11	I then conceive of young people’s status as a social construct that affects their sense of self while they behave as active agents negotiating their position in society.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_12	Similarly, I reconceptualise hitherto fixed categories of information, misinformation, and disinformation as dynamic and socially-produced.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_13	I then position this unstable form of information within Foucauldian descriptions of the relationship between informational truths and the production of power in our society.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_14	I operationalise these new concepts of youth and information in this domain by using Mason’s (2011) facet methodology and mixed qualitative and digital ethnographic techniques.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_15	This combination of concepts (of youth, information, and power) and my research methods, allowed me to investigate the multidirectional and situational environmental and social influences (including my research methods) on youth’s engagements with information on the Web.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_16	My findings show that we cannot effectively isolate and implicate the Web, young people, or their socio-economic status as explanations of why and how young people use the Web for information.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_17	In analysing the data I began by looking for a conceptual framework that would account for the entanglements of technology, people, and society.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_18	This study identifies and analyses how young people’s web practices are defined by “the possibilities and impossibilities” (Bourdieu 1984, p100) that exist within young people’s educational fields and beyond.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_19	Although learning new skills is always important, the social context in which these skills are acquired and used is crucial.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_20	The social environment influences which skills are naturalised, incentivised, and rewarded.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_21	This thesis focuses on this space where, buffeted by the various vested interests who are concerned about how the Web is being utilised; young people are exercising their agency and using the Web in ways that suit their purposes.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_22	My research has found young people are not free to use the Web as they please nor do they always consciously or critically reflect on their own practices, yet they do describe complex patterns of usage that help them explore their sense of self as well as society’s norms and values.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_23	My data shows young people’s Web usage emerges from the tensions between: how they want to use the Web; how they have learnt to use it; how they have been taught to use it; how they have been allowed to use it; and how these tensions are played-out in context of their contingent social reality.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_24	In short, this thesis aims to repatriate young people’s web practices from the sterile, positivist methods space of questionnaires and tests of digital literacy to social contexts of everyday life.

G03.1	smart speaker	2977717854	G03.1_2977717854_1	Smart speakers (such as Amazon Echo and Google Home) are becoming a popular addition to homes, and it is expected that they will be used as parental support in the future.
G03.1	smart speaker	2977717854	G03.1_2977717854_2	Previous studies have analyzed the history logs of the uses of their services and gathered impressions of them using questionnaire surveys and qualitative interviews.
G03.1	smart speaker	2977717854	G03.1_2977717854_3	Details of how children interact with smart speakers have not been fully investigated.
G03.1	smart speaker	2977717854	G03.1_2977717854_4	This study investigated childrenu0027s interactions with an utterance-output device, such as a smart speaker, and focuses on the influences of the childrenu0027s personality traits.
G03.1	smart speaker	2977717854	G03.1_2977717854_5	The experiment was conducted in a realistic setting.
G03.1	smart speaker	2977717854	G03.1_2977717854_6	The results indicate that the less nervous, more emotionally stable, or more adaptable to communication different from that at home children are, the more closely they engage in conversational play with an utterance-output device.
G03.1	smart speaker	2977717854	G03.1_2977717854_7	The findings suggest that effective conversational play, which can lessen anxiety toward a novel utterance-output device, will be required in future interaction design.
G04.1	drug discovery	2170915616	G04.1_2170915616_1	Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are challenging but attractive targets of small molecule drugs for therapeutic interventions of human diseases.
G04.1	drug discovery	2170915616	G04.1_2170915616_2	In this era of rapid accumulation of PPI data, there is great need for a methodology that can efficiently select drug target PPIs by holistically assessing the druggability of PPIs.
G04.1	drug discovery	2170915616	G04.1_2170915616_3	To address this need, we propose here a novel approach based on a supervised machine-learning method, support vector machine (SVM).
G04.3	infectious diseases	2888682363	G04.3_2888682363_1	We recently developed the Genomics Research Integration System (GRIS) to help NIAID investigators at the NIH leverage both phenotypic and genotypic patient data to identify causal variants for rare diseases.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2888682363	G04.3_2888682363_2	The project is a bioinformatics compliment to an initiative to sequence exomes for all NIAID patients visiting the NIH Clinical Center.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2888682363	G04.3_2888682363_3	The system is designed to serve as a valuable resource for clinical genomic data annotated with standardized phenotypic terms using the Human Phenotype Ontology \citeKohler2013.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2888682363	G04.3_2888682363_4	GRIS uses PhenoTips® \citeGirdea2013 to capture clinical records and family pedigrees which are linked to genomic records stored in a genetic analysis tool,seqr, developed at the Broad Institute (\urlseqr.broadinstitute.org ) to enable causal variant identification.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2888682363	G04.3_2888682363_5	"We have customized both programs in novel ways to meet NIH encryption requirements, to link patient records across programs in a controlled manner, and to provide ""tiers"" of access so that individual research groups can customize usersu0027 ability to edit their patient records and view personally identifiable information (PII)."
G04.3	infectious diseases	2888682363	G04.3_2888682363_6	A challenge faced by shared clinical data repositories is to facilitate maximal collective research value of data through open sharing, while respecting the needs of researchers to adjust access to patient data in accordance with research goals and subject to clinical sharing guidelines.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2888682363	G04.3_2888682363_7	We devised a technical approach to meet the needs of sharing policies, formulated collectively by researchers and clinicians, to promote wider acceptance and usage of the system.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2888682363	G04.3_2888682363_8	Accordingly, we implemented a patient identifier mapping system in conjunction with automated notifications to enable transparent sharing.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2888682363	G04.3_2888682363_9	Our approach may prove helpful to other hospital or clinical support systems seeking to respect the confidentiality of patient PII and early findings of individual researchers, while recognizing that data repositories are most primed for discovery (and can significantly increase return on investment) if they are open and accessible to a larger research community.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2092395555	G04.3_2092395555_1	In this paper, we present a fully automatic method to quantify Tree-in-Bud (TIB) patterns for respiratory tract infections.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2092395555	G04.3_2092395555_2	The proposed quantification method is based on our previous effort to detect and track TIB patterns with a computer assisted detection (CAD) system [9].
G04.3	infectious diseases	2092395555	G04.3_2092395555_3	In addition to accurately identifying TIB on CT, quantifying TIB is important for measuring the volume of affected lung as a potantial marker of disease severity.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2092395555	G04.3_2092395555_4	This quantification can be challenging due to the complex shape of TIB and high intensity variation contributing mixed features.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2092395555	G04.3_2092395555_5	Our proposed quantification method is based on a local scale concept such that TIB regions detected via the CAD system are quantified adaptively, and volume percentages of the quantified regions are compared to visual scoring of participating radiologists.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2092395555	G04.3_2092395555_6	We conducted the experiments with a data set of 94 chest CTs (laboratory confirmed 39 viral bronchiolitis caused by human parainfluenza (HPIV), 34 nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM), and 21 normal control).
G04.3	infectious diseases	2092395555	G04.3_2092395555_7	Experimental results show that the proposed quantification system is well suited to the CAD system for detecting TIB patterns.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2092395555	G04.3_2092395555_8	Correlations of observer-CAD agreements are reported as (R2 = 0.824, p u003c 0.01) and (R2 = 0.801, p u003c 0.01) for HPIV and NTM cases, respectively.

G14.2	end to end encryption	2755345740	G14.2_2755345740_1	Due to increased government surveillance as well as data breaches, end-to-end encryption has recently received an increasing attention as a way to protect against such threats.
G14.2	end to end encryption	2755345740	G14.2_2755345740_2	End-to-end (E2E) encryption preserve the confidentiality of data on the wire as well as from service providers by performing encryption/decryption at clients keeping the keys strictly within client devices.
G14.2	end to end encryption	2755345740	G14.2_2755345740_3	There are many variants of end-to-end encryption schemes for different communication patterns.
G14.2	end to end encryption	2755345740	G14.2_2755345740_4	In this paper, we systematically analyze the security of these different variants against three types of passive adversaries and one type of active adversaries.
G14.2	end to end encryption	2755345740	G14.2_2755345740_5	We show that the security of some of these systems are broken under these threat models and what can be done to ensure confidentiality in such systems.
G14.2	end to end encryption	2755345740	G14.2_2755345740_6	We also analyze the existing products in the market and show what level of security they provide.
G14.2	end to end encryption	2755345740	G14.2_2755345740_7	Our study shows that most of the E2E encrypted systems are secure against only the weakest passive adversaries.
G14.2	end to end encryption	2755345740	G14.2_2755345740_8	Further, these systems are broken not by cryptanalysis of underlying cryptographic algorithms but by flawed system designs and security assumptions.
G14.2	end to end encryption	2755345740	G14.2_2755345740_9	Specifically we identify that unencrypted metadata and access patterns make these systems susceptible to inference attacks.
G14.2	end to end encryption	2755345740	G14.2_2755345740_10	We conclude with general design guidelines to securely build such systems.
G14.2	end to end encryption	2581267718	G14.2_2581267718_1	WhatsApp messenger is arguably the most popular mobile app available on all smart-phones.

G14.2	end to end encryption	2581267718	G14.2_2581267718_3	In April 2016, WhatsApp switched to a default end-to-end encrypted service.
G14.2	end to end encryption	2581267718	G14.2_2581267718_4	This means that all messages (SMS), phone calls, videos, audios, and any other form of information exchanged cannot be read by any unauthorized entity since WhatsApp.
G14.2	end to end encryption	2581267718	G14.2_2581267718_5	In this paper we analyze the WhatsApp messaging platform and critique its security architecture along with a focus on its privacy preservation mechanisms.

G14.2	end to end encryption	2581267718	G14.2_2581267718_7	Finally, we argue that simply encrypting the end-to-end channel cannot preserve privacy.
G14.2	end to end encryption	2581267718	G14.2_2581267718_8	The metadata can reveal just enough information to show connections between people, their patterns, and personal information.

G14.2	end to end encryption	227257839	G14.2_227257839_1	Security and privacy have turned out to be major challenges of the further Internet evolution in general and cloud computing, in particular.
G14.2	end to end encryption	227257839	G14.2_227257839_2	This paper proposes a novel approach as to how to safeguard against previously unimpeded insider attacks, referred to as Sealed Cloud.
G14.2	end to end encryption	227257839	G14.2_227257839_3	A canonical set of technical measures is described, which, in conjunction, sufficiently complicate and thus economically prevent insider access to unencrypted data.

G14.2	end to end encryption	227257839	G14.2_227257839_5	Another application of the Sealed Cloud, referred to as Sealed Freeze, provides a seminal solution to privacy issues pertaining to data retention.
G14.2	end to end encryption	1603537120	G14.2_1603537120_1	In usual communication networks, the network operator or an intruder could easily observe when, how much and with whom the users communicate (traffic analysis), even if the users employ end-to-end encryption.
G14.2	end to end encryption	1603537120	G14.2_1603537120_2	When ISDNs are used for almost everything, this becomes a severe threat.
G14.2	end to end encryption	1603537120	G14.2_1603537120_3	Therefore, we summarize basic concepts to keep the recipient and sender or at least their relationship unobservable, consider some possible implementations and necessary hierarchical extensions, and propose some suitable performance and reliability enhancements.
G14.2	end to end encryption	1982799406	G14.2_1982799406_1	The number of instant messages sent per year now exceeds that of email.

G18.1	peer recomendations	2076332737	G18.1_2076332737_1	We explore models of social influence in an open multi-agent system market scenario.Consumer choice is informed by peer recommendations in an evolving social network.We compare the behaviour of two algorithms for selecting recommending peers.We study the link between selection algorithms and the emergent network topologies.We study the impact of the peer selection algorithms on the agentsu0027 performance.
G18.1	peer recomendations	2076332737	G18.1_2076332737_2	Open multi-agent systems are typically formed from heterogeneous peers operating in a decentralised manner.
G18.1	peer recomendations	2076332737	G18.1_2076332737_3	Hence, their constituent agents must evaluate possible actions and opportunities based on local, subjective knowledge.
G18.1	peer recomendations	2076332737	G18.1_2076332737_4	When agents have insufficient personal experience, they may inevitably rely on their social connections to act as a source of relevant information or recommendations.
G18.1	peer recomendations	2076332737	G18.1_2076332737_5	We describe an agent-mediated electronic market for investigating social interaction within the context of evolving heterogeneous distributed networks.
G18.1	peer recomendations	2076332737	G18.1_2076332737_6	In our scenario, consumers look for appropriate services and this service choice is informed via peer recommendations.
G18.1	peer recomendations	2076332737	G18.1_2076332737_7	We define two alternative algorithms for selecting peers based on perceived similarity and we evaluate them on their ability to organise an overlay network such that it acts as a passive filter, tailoring the information that agents use to select services in the market.
G18.1	peer recomendations	2076332737	G18.1_2076332737_8	We use this scenario to explore the link between the peer selection algorithms and the emergent network topologies, as well as the impact of the peer selection algorithm on the agentsu0027 performance in choosing services based on peer recommendations.
G18.1	peer recomendations	2076332737	G18.1_2076332737_9	Our simulation results demonstrate a qualitative difference in the behaviour of the algorithms, with optimal algorithm selection relying on information regarding the preferences of the wider population of agents.
T04.3	nematode	2085701063	T04.3_2085701063_1	One of the most tractable organisms for the study of nervous systems is the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, whose locomotion in particular has been the subject of a number of models.
T04.3	nematode	2085701063	T04.3_2085701063_2	In this paper we present a first integrated neuro-mechanical model of forward locomotion.
T04.3	nematode	2085701063	T04.3_2085701063_3	We find that a previous neural model is robust to the addition of a body with mechanical properties, and that the integrated model produces oscillations with a more realistic frequency and waveform than the neural model alone.
T04.3	nematode	2085701063	T04.3_2085701063_4	We conclude that the body and environment are likely to be important components of the wormu0027s locomotion subsystem.

T09.3	text classification	1483825771	T09.3_1483825771_4	The results show the relevance of part-of-speech information for the pre-processing phase of text classification allowing for a strong reduction of the number of features needed in the text classification.
T09.3	text classification	1582442103	T09.3_1582442103_1	Automated text classification has been considered as an important method to manage and process a huge amount of documents in digital forms that are widespread and continuously increasing.

T09.3	text classification	1582442103	T09.3_1582442103_3	However, most of the investigations in text classification are studied not on real data but on well-organized text corpus, and do not show their usefulness.
T09.3	text classification	1582442103	T09.3_1582442103_4	This paper suggests and analyzes text classification method for a real application, FAQ text classification task, by combining multiple classifiers.
T09.3	text classification	1582442103	T09.3_1582442103_5	We propose two methods of combining multiple neural networks that improve performance by maximum combining and neural network combining.

T09.3	text classification	2026607267	T09.3_2026607267_1	Abstract   In this paper, a classification method named explicit Markov model is applied for text classification.
T09.3	text classification	2026607267	T09.3_2026607267_2	Currently some machine learning technologies, such as support vector machine (SVM), have been discussed widely in text classification.
T09.3	text classification	2026607267	T09.3_2026607267_3	However, these methods consider that any two features are independent and ignore the language structure information.
T09.3	text classification	2026607267	T09.3_2026607267_4	Hidden Markov model is a powerful tool for sequence tagging problems.
T09.3	text classification	2026607267	T09.3_2026607267_5	This paper presents a new method called explicit Markov model (EMM) which is based on HMM for text classification.
T09.3	text classification	2026607267	T09.3_2026607267_6	EMM make better use of the context information between the observation symbols.
T09.3	text classification	2026607267	T09.3_2026607267_7	Our experiments are conducted on three datasets: Reuteru0027s 21578 R8 dataset, WebKB and Fudan University Chinese text classification corpus.
T09.3	text classification	2026607267	T09.3_2026607267_8	Experimental results show that the performance of EMM is comparable to SVM for text classification.
T10.4	vision sensor	2081644865	T10.4_2081644865_1	This paper presents a complete traffic sign recognition system based on vision sensor onboard a moving vehicle which detects and recognizes up to one hundred of the most important road signs, including circular and triangular signs.
T10.4	vision sensor	2081644865	T10.4_2081644865_2	A restricted Hough transform is used as detection method from the information extracted in contour images, while the proposed recognition system is based on Support Vector Machines (SVM).
T10.4	vision sensor	2081644865	T10.4_2081644865_3	A novel solution to the problem of discarding detected signs that do not pertain to the host road is proposed.
T10.4	vision sensor	2081644865	T10.4_2081644865_4	For that purpose infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) communication and a stereo vision sensor are used.
T10.4	vision sensor	2081644865	T10.4_2081644865_5	Furthermore, the outputs provided by the vision sensor and the data supplied by the CAN Bus and a GPS sensor are combined to obtain the global position of the detected traffic signs, which is used to identify a traffic sign in the I2V communication.
T10.4	vision sensor	2081644865	T10.4_2081644865_6	This paper presents plenty of tests in real driving conditions, both day and night, in which an average detection rate over 95% and an average recognition rate around 93% were obtained with an average runtime of 35 ms that allows real-time performance.
T12.3	diagnosis	1501799430	T12.3_1501799430_1	We propose a novel multiple-instance learning(MIL) algorithm for designing classifiers for use in computer aided detection(CAD).
T12.3	diagnosis	1501799430	T12.3_1501799430_2	The proposed algorithm has 3 advantages over classical methods.
T12.3	diagnosis	1501799430	T12.3_1501799430_3	First, unlike traditional learning algorithms that minimize the candidate level misclassification error, the proposed algorithm directly optimizes the patient-wise sensitivity.
T12.3	diagnosis	1501799430	T12.3_1501799430_4	Second, this algorithm automatically selects a small subset of statistically useful features.
T12.3	diagnosis	1501799430	T12.3_1501799430_5	Third, this algorithm is very fast, utilizes all of the available training data (without the need for cross-validation etc.
T12.3	diagnosis	1501799430	T12.3_1501799430_6	), and requires no human hand tuning or intervention.
T12.3	diagnosis	1501799430	T12.3_1501799430_7	Experimentally the algorithm is more accurate than state of the art support vector machine (SVM) classifier, and substantially reduces the number of features that have to be computed.

T12.4	healthcare	184272183	T12.4_184272183_1	Personal Health Records (PHRs) are a rapidly expanding area of medical informatics due to the belief that they may improve health care delivery and control costs of care.
T12.4	healthcare	184272183	T12.4_184272183_2	The PHRs in use or in development today support a myriad of different functions, and consequently offer different value propositions.
T12.4	healthcare	184272183	T12.4_184272183_3	A comprehensive value analysis of PHRs has never been conducted; such analysis is needed to identify those PHR functions that yield the greatest value to PHR stakeholders.
T12.4	healthcare	184272183	T12.4_184272183_4	Here we present a framework that could serve as a foundation for determining the value of PHR functions and thereby help optimize PHR development.
T12.4	healthcare	184272183	T12.4_184272183_5	While the value framework is specific to the domain of PHRs, the authors have successfully applied the associated evaluation methodology in assessing other health care information technologies.
T13.1	fairness	2363800589	T13.1_2363800589_1	Networks need to provide consistent end-to-end Quality of Service to all new applicants in packet-switched networks.End-to-end QoS and system fairness are improved by a network proportional fairness scheduling strategy(nPFS) using proportionally differentiated services.The strategy integrates several objects such as the network performance,useru0027s QoS requirements,and system fairness with the proportional fairness principle to provide end-to-end traffic control that satisfies multiple performance objectives and system fairness.Simulations show that the network proportional fairness scheduling strategy efficiently guarantees proportional fairness in multiplex service classes,especially the end-to-end quality of service proportional fairness.
T13.1	fairness	1557876268	T13.1_1557876268_1	In modeling a concurrent system, fairness constraints are usually considered at a specific granularity level of the system, leading to many different variants of fairness: transition fairness, object/process fairness, actor fairness, etc.
T13.1	fairness	1557876268	T13.1_1557876268_2	These different notions of fairness can be unified by making explicit their parametrization over the relevant entities in the system as universal quantification.
T13.1	fairness	1557876268	T13.1_1557876268_3	We propose a state/event-based framework as well as an on-the-fly model checking algorithm to verify LTL properties under universally quantified parametric fairness assumptions, specified by generalized strong/weak fairness formulas.

T16.1	credit card fraud	2612056740	T16.1_2612056740_2	In this paper, we proposed the use of six known models, namely, decision tree, random forest, Bayesian network, Naive Bayes, support vector machine, and K* models, to form an ensemble for the detection of credit card fraud.
T16.1	credit card fraud	2612056740	T16.1_2612056740_3	We focused on the voting mechanisms used by the ensemble and proposed optimistic, pessimistic, and weighted voting strategies.
T16.1	credit card fraud	2612056740	T16.1_2612056740_4	The proposed model is called optimistic, pessimistic, and weighted voting in an ensemble of models.
T16.1	credit card fraud	2612056740	T16.1_2612056740_5	A dataset of real credit card transactions from a leading bank in Turkey was used to evaluate the performance of optimistic, pessimistic, and weighted voting in an ensemble of models.
T16.1	credit card fraud	2612056740	T16.1_2612056740_6	The results showed that the optimistic voting strategy enables the detection of 31.59% of fraudulent transactions with a false alarm rate of only 0.10%, the pessimistic voting strategy detects 93.92% of fraudulent transactions with a false alarm rate of 13.72%, and the weighted voting strategy detects 64.02% of fraudulent transactions with a false alarm rate of 0.75%.
T16.1	credit card fraud	2612056740	T16.1_2612056740_7	Banks can choose among these voting mechanisms depending on their preferred strategies for fraud detection and desired false alarm rates.
T16.1	credit card fraud	2045049630	T16.1_2045049630_1	Credit card fraud is a serious and growing problem.
T16.1	credit card fraud	2045049630	T16.1_2045049630_2	While predictive models for credit card fraud detection are in active use in practice, reported studies on the use of data mining approaches for credit card fraud detection are relatively few, possibly due to the lack of available data for research.
T16.1	credit card fraud	2045049630	T16.1_2045049630_3	This paper evaluates two advanced data mining approaches, support vector machines and random forests, together with the well-known logistic regression, as part of an attempt to better detect (and thus control and prosecute) credit card fraud.

G07.2	conspiracy theories	2039222427	G07.2_2039222427_3	Pages are categorized, according to their topics and the communities of interests they pertain to, in (a) alternative information sources (diffusing topics that are neglected by science and main stream media); (b) online political activism; and (c) main stream media.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2039222427	G07.2_2039222427_4	We show that attention patterns are similar despite the different qualitative nature of the information, meaning that unsubstantiated claims (mainly conspiracy theories) reverberate for as long as other information.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2039222427	G07.2_2039222427_5	Finally, we classify users according to their interaction patterns among the different topics and measure how they responded to the injection of 2788 false information.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2039222427	G07.2_2039222427_6	Our analysis reveals that users which are prominently interacting with conspiracists information sources are more prone to interact with intentional false claims.

G07.2	conspiracy theories	2253498108	G07.2_2253498108_1	Online video-sharing sites such as YouTube are very popular and also used by a lot of people to obtain knowledge and information, also on science, health and technology.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2253498108	G07.2_2253498108_2	Technically they could be valuable tools for the public communication of science and technology, but the users of YouTube are also confronted with conspiracy theories and erroneous and misleading information that deviates from scientific consensus views.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2253498108	G07.2_2253498108_3	This contribution details the results of a study that investigates what kind of information users find when they are searching for climate science and climate manipulation topics on YouTube and whether this information corresponds with or challenges scientific consensus views.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2253498108	G07.2_2253498108_4	An innovative methodological approach using the anonymization network Tor is introduced for drawing randomized samples of YouTube videos.

G07.2	conspiracy theories	2294382086	G07.2_2294382086_2	This Big Data holds promises of new insights, unparalleled innovation, even artificial intelligence.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2294382086	G07.2_2294382086_3	"However, the ubiquity and availability of data connected to our human desire to see patterns where none exist means that humans have to deal with increasing amounts of meaningless data analysis, ""fact-based"" conspiracy theories and click-bait infographics."
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2296706733	G07.2_2296706733_1	Massive amounts of misinformation have been observed to spread in uncontrolled fashion across social media.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2296706733	G07.2_2296706733_10	With the increasing risks connected to massive online misinformation, social news observatories have the potential to help researchers, journalists, and the general public understand the dynamics of real and fake news sharing.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2296706733	G07.2_2296706733_2	Examples include rumors, hoaxes, fake news, and conspiracy theories.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2296706733	G07.2_2296706733_3	At the same time, several journalistic organizations devote significant efforts to high-quality fact checking of online claims.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2296706733	G07.2_2296706733_4	The resulting information cascades contain instances of both accurate and inaccurate information, unfold over multiple time scales, and often reach audiences of considerable size.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2296706733	G07.2_2296706733_5	All these factors pose challenges for the study of the social dynamics of online news sharing.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2296706733	G07.2_2296706733_6	Here we introduce Hoaxy, a platform for the collection, detection, and analysis of online misinformation and its related fact-checking efforts.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2296706733	G07.2_2296706733_7	We discuss the design of the platform and present a preliminary analysis of a sample of public tweets containing both fake news and fact checking.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2296706733	G07.2_2296706733_8	We find that, in the aggregate, the sharing of fact-checking content typically lags that of misinformation by 10-20 hours.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2296706733	G07.2_2296706733_9	Moreover, fake news are dominated by very active users, while fact checking is a more grass-roots activity.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2402988752	G07.2_2402988752_1	Despite widespread political conspiracy theories about Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, a majority of partisans continue to distance themselves from such beliefs.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2402988752	G07.2_2402988752_2	Even so, the ideological biases that drive conspiratorial thinking may be hard to overcome.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2402988752	G07.2_2402988752_3	In this study, we examine the unintentional endorsement of conspiratorial beliefs as revealed in movement dynamics.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2402988752	G07.2_2402988752_4	We track the cursor movements of Republicans and Democrats as they click target regions on their computer screens, ostensibly providing bias-free opinions (e.g., clicking “FALSE” upon reading “Barack Obama was born in Kenya”).
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2402988752	G07.2_2402988752_5	However, during these response movements, we find inhibition and movement attraction to regions of the screen where a competitor response is located (e.g., “TRUE” for the “birther” conspiracy).
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2402988752	G07.2_2402988752_6	These dynamics are not present for general conspiracies or political knowledge items.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2402988752	G07.2_2402988752_7	Though both Republicans and Democrats show evidence of implicit biases, changes in the strength of competition also reveal key asymmetrical differences.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2527044893	G07.2_2527044893_1	The massive diffusion of online social media allows for the rapid and uncontrolled spreading of conspiracy theories, hoaxes, unsubstantiated claims, and false news.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2527044893	G07.2_2527044893_2	Such an impressive amount of misinformation can influence policy preferences and encourage behaviors strongly divergent from recommended practices.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2527044893	G07.2_2527044893_3	In this paper, we study the statistical properties of viral misinformation in online social media.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2527044893	G07.2_2527044893_4	By means of methods belonging to Extreme Value Theory, we show that the number of extremely viral posts over time follows a homogeneous Poisson process, and that the interarrival times between such posts are independent and identically distributed, following an exponential distribution.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2527044893	G07.2_2527044893_5	Moreover, we characterize the uncertainty around the rate parameter of the Poisson process through Bayesian methods.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2527044893	G07.2_2527044893_6	Finally, we are able to derive the predictive posterior probability distribution of the number of posts exceeding a certain threshold of shares over a finite interval of time.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2532284773	G07.2_2532284773_1	Misinformation under the form of rumor, hoaxes, and conspiracy theories spreads on social media at alarming rates.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2532284773	G07.2_2532284773_2	One hypothesis is that, since social media are shaped by homophily, belief in misinformation may be more likely to thrive on those social circles that are segregated from the rest of the network.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2532284773	G07.2_2532284773_3	One possible antidote to misinformation is fact checking which, however, does not always stop rumors from spreading further, owing to selective exposure and our limited attention.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2532284773	G07.2_2532284773_4	What are the conditions under which factual verification are effective at containing the spreading of misinformation?
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2532284773	G07.2_2532284773_5	Here we take into account the combination of selective exposure due to network segregation, forgetting (i.e., finite memory), and fact-checking.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2532284773	G07.2_2532284773_6	We consider a compartmental model of two interacting epidemic processes over a network that is segregated between gullible and skeptic users.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2532284773	G07.2_2532284773_7	Extensive simulation and mean-field analysis show that a more segregated network facilitates the spread of a hoax only at low forgetting rates, but has no effect when agents forget at faster rates.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2532284773	G07.2_2532284773_8	This finding may inform the development of mitigation techniques and raise awareness on the risks of uncontrolled misinformation online.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2539931556	G07.2_2539931556_1	Online Social Networks explode with activity whenever a crisis event takes place.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2539931556	G07.2_2539931556_2	Most content generated as part of this activity is a mixture of text and images, and is particularly useful for first responders to identify popular topics of interest and gauge the pulse and sentiment of citizens.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2539931556	G07.2_2539931556_3	While multiple researchers have used text to identify, analyze and measure themes and public sentiment during such events, little work has explored visual themes floating on networks in the form of images, and the sentiment inspired by them.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2539931556	G07.2_2539931556_4	Given the potential of visual content for influencing usersu0027 thoughts and emotions, we perform a large scale analysis to compare popular themes and sentiment across images and textual content posted on Facebook during the terror attacks that took place in Paris in 2015.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2539931556	G07.2_2539931556_5	Using state-of-the-art image summarization techniques, we discovered multiple visual themes which were popular in images, but were not identifiable through text.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2539931556	G07.2_2539931556_6	We uncovered instances of misinformation and false flag (conspiracy) theories among popular image themes, which were not prominent in user generated textual content, and can be of particular inter- est to first responders.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2539931556	G07.2_2539931556_7	Our analysis also revealed that while textual content posted after the attacks reflected negative sentiment, images inspired positive sentiment.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2539931556	G07.2_2539931556_8	To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large scale study of images posted on social networks during a crisis event.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2572918643	G07.2_2572918643_1	Given the huge impact that Online Social Networks (OSN) had in the way people get informed and form their opinion, they became an attractive playground for malicious entities that want to spread misinformation, and leverage their effect.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2572918643	G07.2_2572918643_2	"In fact, misinformation easily spreads on OSN, and this is a huge threat for modern society, possibly influencing also the outcome of elections, or even putting peopleu0027s life at risk (e.g., spreading ""anti-vaccines"" misinformation)."
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2572918643	G07.2_2572918643_3	"Therefore, it is of paramount importance for our society to have some sort of ""validation"" on information spreading through OSN."
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2572918643	G07.2_2572918643_4	The need for a wide-scale validation would greatly benefit from automatic tools.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2572918643	G07.2_2572918643_5	In this paper, we show that it is difficult to carry out an automatic classification of misinformation considering only structural properties of content propagation cascades.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2572918643	G07.2_2572918643_6	We focus on structural properties, because they would be inherently difficult to be manipulated, with the the aim of circumventing classification systems.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2572918643	G07.2_2572918643_7	To support our claim, we carry out an extensive evaluation on Facebook posts belonging to conspiracy theories (representative of misinformation), and scientific news (representative of fact-checked content).
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2572918643	G07.2_2572918643_8	Our findings show that conspiracy content reverberates in a way which is hard to distinguish from scientific content: for the classification mechanism we investigated, classification F-score never exceeds 0.7.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2768838852	G07.2_2768838852_1	Extensive research has been conducted to identify, analyze and measure popular topics and public sentiment on Online Social Networks (OSNs) through text, especially during crisis events.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2768838852	G07.2_2768838852_2	However, little work has been done to understand such events through pictures posted on these networks.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2768838852	G07.2_2768838852_3	Given the potential of visual content for influencing usersu0027 thoughts and emotions, we perform a large-scale analysis to study and compare popular themes and sentiment across images and textual content posted on Facebook during the terror attacks that took place in Paris in 2015.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2768838852	G07.2_2768838852_4	We propose a generalizable and highly automated 3-tier pipeline which utilizes state-of-the-art computer vision techniques to extract high-level human understandable image descriptors.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2768838852	G07.2_2768838852_5	We used these descriptors to associate themes and sentiment with images, and analyzed over 57,000 images related to the Paris Attacks.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2768838852	G07.2_2768838852_6	We discovered multiple visual themes which were popular in images, but were not identifiable through text.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2768838852	G07.2_2768838852_7	We also uncovered instances of misinformation and false flag (conspiracy) theories among popular image themes, which were not prominent in user-generated textual content.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2768838852	G07.2_2768838852_8	Further, our analysis revealed that while textual content posted after the attacks reflected negative sentiment, images inspired positive sentiment.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2768838852	G07.2_2768838852_9	These findings suggest that large-scale mining of images posted on OSNs during crisis, and other news-making events can significantly augment textual content to understand such events.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2785127572	G07.2_2785127572_1	Conspiracy theories cover topics from politicians to world events.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2785127572	G07.2_2785127572_2	Frequently, proponents of conspiracies hold these beliefs strongly despite available evidence that may challenge or disprove them.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2785127572	G07.2_2785127572_3	Therefore, conspiratorial reasoning has often been described as illegitimate or flawed.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2785127572	G07.2_2785127572_4	Here, we explore the possibility of growing a rational (Bayesian) conspiracy theorist through an Agent-Based Model.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2785127572	G07.2_2785127572_5	The agent has reasonable constraints on access to the total information as well its access to the global population.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2785127572	G07.2_2785127572_6	The model shows that network structures are central to maintain objectively mistaken beliefs.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2785127572	G07.2_2785127572_7	Increasing the size of the available network, yielded increased confidence in mistaken beliefs and subsequent network pruning, allowing for belief purism.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2785127572	G07.2_2785127572_8	Rather than ameliorating and correcting mistaken beliefs (where agents move toward the correct mean), large networks appear to maintain and strengthen them.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2785127572	G07.2_2785127572_9	As such, large networks may increase the potential for belief polarization, extreme beliefs, and conspiratorial thinking – even amongst Bayesian agents.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2786771136	G07.2_2786771136_1	Social media provides political news and information for both active duty military personnel and veterans.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2786771136	G07.2_2786771136_2	We analyze the subgroups of Twitter and Facebook users who spend time consuming junk news from websites that target US military personnel and veterans with conspiracy theories, misinformation, and other forms of junk news about military affairs and national security issues.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2786771136	G07.2_2786771136_3	(1) Over Twitter we find that there are significant and persistent interactions between current and former military personnel and a broad network of extremist, Russia-focused, and international conspiracy subgroups.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2786771136	G07.2_2786771136_4	(2) Over Facebook, we find significant and persistent interactions between public pages for military and veterans and subgroups dedicated to political conspiracy, and both sides of the political spectrum.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2786771136	G07.2_2786771136_5	(3) Over Facebook, the users who are most interested in conspiracy theories and the political right seem to be distributing the most junk news, whereas users who are either in the military or are veterans are among the most sophisticated news consumers, and share very little junk news through the network.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2787296320	G07.2_2787296320_1	Abstract   The problem of detecting bots, automated social media accounts governed by software but disguising as human users, has strong implications.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2787296320	G07.2_2787296320_2	For example, bots have been used to sway political elections by distorting online discourse, to manipulate the stock market, or to push anti-vaccine conspiracy theories that may have caused health epidemics.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2787296320	G07.2_2787296320_3	Most techniques proposed to date detect bots at the account level, by processing large amounts of social media posts, and leveraging information from network structure, temporal dynamics, sentiment analysis, etc.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2787296320	G07.2_2787296320_4	In this paper, we propose a deep neural network based on contextual long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture that exploits both content and metadata to detect bots at the tweet level: contextual features are extracted from user metadata and fed as auxiliary input to LSTM deep nets processing the tweet text.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2787296320	G07.2_2787296320_5	Another contribution that we make is proposing a technique based on synthetic minority oversampling to generate a large labeled dataset, suitable for deep nets training, from a minimal amount of labeled data (roughly 3000 examples of sophisticated Twitter bots).
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2787296320	G07.2_2787296320_6	We demonstrate that, from just one single tweet, our architecture can achieve high classification accuracy (AUC  u003e  96%) in separating bots from humans.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2787296320	G07.2_2787296320_7	We apply the same architecture to account-level bot detection, achieving nearly perfect classification accuracy (AUC  u003e  99%).
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2787296320	G07.2_2787296320_8	Our system outperforms previous state of the art while leveraging a small and interpretable set of features, yet requiring minimal training data.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2795069772	G07.2_2795069772_1	The deluge of online and offline misinformation is overloading the exchange of ideas upon which democracies depend.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2795069772	G07.2_2795069772_2	Fake news, conspiracy theories, and deceptive social bots proliferate, facilitating the manipulation of public opinion.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2795069772	G07.2_2795069772_3	Countering misinformation while protecting freedom of speech will require collaboration across industry, journalism, and academia.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2795069772	G07.2_2795069772_4	The Workshop on Digital Misinformation — held in May 2017 in conjunction with the International Conference on Web and Social Media in Montreal, Quebec, Canada — was intended to foster these efforts.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2795069772	G07.2_2795069772_5	The meeting brought together more than 100 stakeholders from academia, media, and tech companies to discuss the research challenges implicit in building a trustworthy Web.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2795069772	G07.2_2795069772_6	Below we outline the main findings from the discussion.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2803291160	G07.2_2803291160_1	In this paper, we analyze the content of the most popular videos posted on YouTube in the first phase of the Zika-virus outbreak in 2016, and the user responses to those videos.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2803291160	G07.2_2803291160_2	More specifically, we examine the extent to which informational and conspiracy theory videos differ in terms of user activity (number of comments, shares, likes and dislikes), and the sentiment and content of the user responses.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2803291160	G07.2_2803291160_3	Our results show that 12 out of the 35 videos in our data set focused on conspiracy theories, but no statistical differences were found in the number of user activity and sentiment between the two types of videos.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2803291160	G07.2_2803291160_4	The content of the user responses shows that users respond differently to sub-topics related to Zika-virus.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2883309640	G07.2_2883309640_1	Abstract The present study investigates the characteristics of discussion of conspiracy theories about the Zika virus outbreak of 2015–16 on Twitter.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2883309640	G07.2_2883309640_2	Content and social network analysis of a dataset of 25,162 original Tweets about Zika virus conspiracy theories showed that relative to debunking messages, conspiracy theories spread through a more decentralized network, are more likely to invoke supposedly knowledgeable authorities in making arguments, and ask more rhetorical questions.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2898510718	G07.2_2898510718_1	YouTube, since its inception in 2005, has grown to become largest online video sharing website.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2898510718	G07.2_2898510718_2	Itu0027s massive userbase uploads videos and generates discussion by commenting on these videos.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2898510718	G07.2_2898510718_3	Lately, YouTube, akin to other social media sites, has become a vehicle for spreading fake news, propaganda, conspiracy theories, and radicalizing content.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2898510718	G07.2_2898510718_4	However, lack ineffective image and video processing techniques has hindered research on YouTube.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2898510718	G07.2_2898510718_5	In this paper, we advocate the use of metadata in identifying such malicious behaviors.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2898510718	G07.2_2898510718_6	Specifically, we analyze metadata of videos (e.g., comments, commenters) to study a channel on YouTube that was pushing content promoting conspiracy theories regarding World War III.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2898510718	G07.2_2898510718_7	Identifying signals that could be used to detect such deviant content (e.g., videos, comments) can help in stemming the spread of disinformation.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2898510718	G07.2_2898510718_8	We collected over 4,145 videos along with 16,493 comments from YouTube.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2898510718	G07.2_2898510718_9	We analyze user engagement to assess the reach of the channel and apply social network analysis techniques to identify inorganic behaviors.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2945924652	G07.2_2945924652_1	Increased polarization and partisanship have become a consistent state of politics, media, and society, especially in the United States.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2945924652	G07.2_2945924652_2	As many news publishers are perceived as “biased” and some others have come under attack as being “fake news”, efforts to make such labels stick have increased too.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2945924652	G07.2_2945924652_3	In some cases (e.g., InfoWars), the use of such labels is legitimate, because some online publishers deliberately spread conspiracy theories and false stories.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2945924652	G07.2_2945924652_4	Other news publishers are perceived as partisan and biased, in ways that damages their reporting credibility.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2945924652	G07.2_2945924652_5	Whether political bias affects journalism standards appears to be a debated topic with no clear consensus.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2945924652	G07.2_2945924652_6	Meanwhile, labels such as “far-left” or “alt-right” are highly contested and may become cause for prolonged edit wars on the Wikipedia pages of some news sources.
T13.1	fairness	1509882388	T13.1_1509882388_1	Fairness is an important concept in design and implementation of distributed systems.
T13.1	fairness	1509882388	T13.1_1509882388_2	At the specification level, fairness usually serves as an assumption for proving liveness.
T13.1	fairness	2118327397	T13.1_2118327397_9	Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is successful in ensuring global fairness in the bridged network.
T13.1	fairness	2139304285	T13.1_2139304285_2	Several fairness index measurements have been proposed in the technical literature.
T13.1	fairness	2139304285	T13.1_2139304285_4	Instantaneous fairness property has not been captured.
T13.1	fairness	2296143973	T13.1_2296143973_3	In this paper, we explore the proportional fairness and the time fairness.
T13.1	fairness	2296143973	T13.1_2296143973_7	Next, we show that the time fairness is a special case of weighted max---min fairness with the weight for a node is equal to its transmission rate.
T13.1	fairness	2296143973	T13.1_2296143973_8	Thus, the existing algorithms to achieve weighted max---min fairness can be used to achieve time fairness as well.
T13.1	fairness	2899682787	T13.1_2899682787_1	Fairness and efficiency are generally two important metrics for users in modern cloud computing.

T13.1	fairness	2899682787	T13.1_2899682787_3	Quantitatively showing the fairness degradation/loss becomes essentially important in the design of any fairness-efficiency tradeoff scheduler.
T13.1	fairness	2899682787	T13.1_2899682787_6	First, it cannot quantitatively tell how much relaxed fairness can be guaranteed (i.e., QoS of fairness guarantee) given a knob value.
T13.1	fairness	2899682787	T13.1_2899682787_7	Second, it fails to meet several essential properties such as sharing incentive.
T13.1	fairness	8324080	T13.1_8324080_1	Recent research has found that fairness plays a key role in customer satisfaction.
T13.1	fairness	8324080	T13.1_8324080_2	Fairness in an online context and how it influences customer satisfaction, however, has yet been investigated.
T13.1	fairness	8324080	T13.1_8324080_3	This research examines satisfaction from a fairness lens and explores the mediators of fairness to satisfaction in the internet bank context.
T13.1	fairness	8324080	T13.1_8324080_4	131 surveys were analyzed and results show that in internet bank, fairness that includes distributive fairness, procedural fairness and informational fairness is positively related to customer satisfaction.
T13.1	fairness	8324080	T13.1_8324080_5	Trust and value are identified as two key mediators of fairness to customer satisfaction.

G01.2		2735798741	G01.2_2735798741_1	One source of software project challenges and failures is the systematic errors introduced by human cognitive biases.
G01.2		2735798741	G01.2_2735798741_2	Although extensively explored in cognitive psychology, investigations concerning cognitive biases have only recently gained popularity in software engineering (SE) research.
G01.2		2735798741	G01.2_2735798741_3	This paper therefore systematically maps, aggregates and synthesizes the literature on cognitive biases in software engineering to generate a comprehensive body of knowledge, understand state of the art research and provide guidelines for future research and practice.
G01.2		2735798741	G01.2_2735798741_4	Focusing on bias antecedents, effects and mitigation techniques, we identified 67 articles, which investigated 47 cognitive biases, published between 1990 and 2016.
G01.2		2735798741	G01.2_2735798741_5	Despite strong and increasing interest, the results reveal a scarcity of research on mitigation techniques and poor theoretical foundations in understanding and interpreting cognitive biases.
G01.2		2735798741	G01.2_2735798741_6	Although bias-related research has generated many new insights in the software engineering community, specific bias mitigation techniques are still needed for software professionals to overcome the deleterious effects of cognitive biases on their work.

G01.2		2949551437	G01.2_2949551437_2	We present a detailed study on the nature of biases in network sampling strategies to shed light on how best to sample from networks.
G01.2		2949551437	G01.2_2949551437_3	We investigate connections between specific biases and various measures of structural representativeness.

G01.2		2949551437	G01.2_2949551437_5	Finally, we describe how these sampling biases can be exploited in several, real-world applications including disease outbreak detection and market research.

G01.2		2920846490	G01.2_2920846490_1	Dual process theories of intertemporal decision making propose that decision makers automatically favor immediate rewards.
G01.2		2920846490	G01.2_2920846490_2	In this paper, we use a drift diffusion model to implement these theories, and empirically investigate the role of their proposed automatic biases.
G01.2		2920846490	G01.2_2920846490_3	Our model permits automatic biases in the response process, in the form of a shifted starting point, as well as automatic biases in the evaluation process, in the form of an additive drift rate intercept.
G01.2		2920846490	G01.2_2920846490_4	We fit our model to individual-level choice and response time data, and find that automatic biases (as measured though the starting point and drift rate intercept in our model) are prevalent in intertemporal choice, but that the type, magnitude, and direction of these biases vary greatly across individuals.
G01.2		2920846490	G01.2_2920846490_5	Our results pose new challenges for theories of intertemporal choice behavior.
G01.2		2399149119	G01.2_2399149119_1	This paper discusses different biases which have been identified in Intelligence Analysis and how TIACRITIS, a knowledge-based cognitive assistant for evidence-based hypotheses analysis, can help recognize and partially counter them.
G01.2		2399149119	G01.2_2399149119_2	After reviewing the architecture of TIACRITIS, the paper shows how it helps recognize and counter many of the analysts’ biases in the evaluation of evidence, in the perception of cause and effect, in the estimation of probabilities, and in the retrospective evaluation of intelligence reports.
G01.2		2399149119	G01.2_2399149119_3	Then the paper introduces three other types of bias that are rarely discussed, biases of the sources of testimonial evidence, biases in the chain of custody of evidence, and biases of the consumers of intelligence, which can also be recognized and countered with TIACRITIS.

G01.2		1493775635	G01.2_1493775635_1	Developing models and estimating parameters for multi-criteria decision analysis requires judgments by experts and decision makers.
G01.2		1493775635	G01.2_1493775635_2	These judgments are subject to biases, which can reduce the quality of the analysis.
G01.2		1493775635	G01.2_1493775635_3	Some of these biases are due to faulty cognitive processes, some are due to motivations for preferred analysis outcomes.
G01.2		1493775635	G01.2_1493775635_4	We describe these biases, how they affect multi-criteria decision analysis and discuss some debiasing techniques.

G01.2		2954519354	G01.2_2954519354_1	Word embeddings have recently been shown to reflect many of the pronounced societal biases (e.g., gender bias or racial bias).
G01.2		2954519354	G01.2_2954519354_2	Existing studies are, however, limited in scope and do not investigate the consistency of biases across relevant dimensions like embedding models, types of texts, and different languages.
G01.2		2954519354	G01.2_2954519354_3	In this work, we present a systematic study of biases encoded in distributional word vector spaces: we analyze how consistent the bias effects are across languages, corpora, and embedding models.
G01.2		2954519354	G01.2_2954519354_4	Furthermore, we analyze the cross-lingual biases encoded in bilingual embedding spaces, indicative of the effects of bias transfer encompassed in cross-lingual transfer of NLP models.
G01.2		2954519354	G01.2_2954519354_5	Our study yields some unexpected findings, e.g., that biases can be emphasized or downplayed by different embedding models or that user-generated content may be less biased than encyclopedic text.
G01.2		2954519354	G01.2_2954519354_6	We hope our work catalyzes bias research in NLP and informs the development of bias reduction techniques.

G01.2		2955503152	G01.2_2955503152_1	Popular Natural Language Inference (NLI) datasets have been shown to be tainted by hypothesis-only biases.
G01.2		2955503152	G01.2_2955503152_2	Adversarial learning may help models ignore sensitive biases and spurious correlations in data.
G01.2		2955503152	G01.2_2955503152_3	We evaluate whether adversarial learning can be used in NLI to encourage models to learn representations free of hypothesis-only biases.
G01.2		2955503152	G01.2_2955503152_4	Our analyses indicate that the representations learned via adversarial learning may be less biased, with only small drops in NLI accuracy.
G01.2		2955751172	G01.2_2955751172_1	It has been well-known that the software development profession lacks gender diversity, particularly in the technical leadership positions.
G01.2		2955751172	G01.2_2955751172_2	Researchers and practitioners have spent tremendous efforts on identifying the problems and finding solutions.
G01.2		2955751172	G01.2_2955751172_3	However, most of the existing software engineering literature focuses on the explicit gender biases but ignores implicit gender biases.
G01.2		2955751172	G01.2_2955751172_4	To fill this gap, the study sought to empirically investigate whether professional software engineers hold implicit gender biases related to women in the software development profession, and examine whether these implicit biases predict discriminatory decision-making.
G01.2		2955751172	G01.2_2955751172_5	Using data from 142 professional software engineers in seven organizations, our study yields a rich set of concerning findings.
G01.2		2955751172	G01.2_2955751172_6	First, we find that implicit biases were pervasive-both male and female software engineers implicitly associated software development professions, particular technical leadership roles, with men, not women, and also associated women with the home and family.
G01.2		2955751172	G01.2_2955751172_7	Besides, people often cannot resist their implicit gender biases and make decisions in gender-neutral ways while they do well in resisting their explicit gender biases.
G01.2		2623480741	G01.2_2623480741_1	Recent work has considered theoretical models for the behavior of agents with specific behavioral biases: rather than making decisions that optimize a given payoff function, the agent behaves inefficiently because its decisions suffer from an underlying bias.
G01.2		2623480741	G01.2_2623480741_2	These approaches have generally considered an agent who experiences a single behavioral bias, studying the effect of this bias on the outcome.
G01.2		2623480741	G01.2_2623480741_3	In general, however, decision-making can and will be affected by multiple biases operating at the same time.
G01.2		2623480741	G01.2_2623480741_4	How do multiple biases interact to produce the overall outcome?
G01.2		2623480741	G01.2_2623480741_5	Here we consider decisions in the presence of a pair of biases exhibiting an intuitively natural interaction: present bias -- the tendency to value costs incurred in the present too highly -- and sunk-cost bias -- the tendency to incorporate costs experienced in the past into oneu0027s plans for the future.
G01.2		2623480741	G01.2_2623480741_6	We propose a theoretical model for planning with this pair of biases, and we show how certain natural behavioral phenomena can arise in our model only when agents exhibit both biases.
G01.2		2623480741	G01.2_2623480741_7	As part of our model we differentiate between agents that are aware of their biases (sophisticated) and agents that are unaware of them (naive).
G01.2		2623480741	G01.2_2623480741_8	Interestingly, we show that the interaction between the two biases is quite complex: in some cases, they mitigate each otheru0027s effects while in other cases they might amplify each other.
G01.2		2623480741	G01.2_2623480741_9	We obtain a number of further results as well, including the fact that the planning problem in our model for an agent experiencing and aware of both biases is computationally hard in general, though tractable under more relaxed assumptions.

G02.1		2036899576	G02.1_2036899576_2	In this algorithm, the solution space of an optimization problem is divided into Q subspaces.

G02.1		2117278286	G02.1_2117278286_3	This paper first reviews the existing CPP tools.
G02.1		2117278286	G02.1_2117278286_4	Then a conversation model during CPP process is presented based on language/action perspective.
G02.1		2117278286	G02.1_2117278286_5	Some basic requirements of CPP tool are given in terms of the conversation model.
G02.1		2117278286	G02.1_2117278286_6	Finally, a framework of CPP tool is presented.
G02.1		2117278286	G02.1_2117278286_7	The framework allows not only to use the same editor between the pairs, but also to support different editors or developing environments between them.
G02.1		1997490831	G02.1_1997490831_1	It is difficult to make a robot intercept a moving target, whose trajectory and speed are unknown and dynamically changing, in a comparatively short distance when the environment contains complex objects.
G02.1		1997490831	G02.1_1997490831_2	This paper presents a new moving target interception algorithm in which the robot can intercept such a target by following many short straight line trajectories.
G02.1		1997490831	G02.1_1997490831_3	In the algorithm, an intercept point is first forecasted assuming that the robot and the target both move along straight line trajectories.
G02.1		1997490831	G02.1_1997490831_4	The robot rapidly plans a navigation path to this projected intercept point by using the new ant algorithm.
G02.1		1997490831	G02.1_1997490831_5	The robot walks along the planned path while continuously monitoring the target.
G02.1		1997490831	G02.1_1997490831_6	When the robot detects that the target has moved to a new grid it will re-forecast the intercept point and re-plan the navigation path.
G02.1		1997490831	G02.1_1997490831_7	This process will be repeated until the robot has intercepted the moving target.
G02.1		1997490831	G02.1_1997490831_8	The simulation results have shown that the algorithm is very effective and can successfully intercept a moving target while moving along a relatively short path no matter whether the environment has complex obstacles or not and the actual trajectory of the moving target is a straight line or a complex curve.
G02.1		1974366615	G02.1_1974366615_1	Aeronautics and space are extraordinarily technical fields of engineering and science that reside within a niche characterized by unique end-product requirements.
G02.1		1974366615	G02.1_1974366615_2	The severe operating conditions in flight or in space, in combination with the need for mission-critical reliability, create a difficult and challenging level of expectation for those who develop the hardware and software that goes into systems for aeronautics and space.
G02.1		2061638958	G02.1_2061638958_1	We consider in this paper a variation of Csiszar and Korneru0027s model of broadcast channels with confidential messages.
G02.1		2061638958	G02.1_2061638958_2	The transmitter sends both a confidential message and a non-confidential message (herein termed as public message) to receiver 1.
G02.1		2061638958	G02.1_2061638958_3	While receiver 2 should be kept ignorant from the confidential message, we do not impose the requirement that the public message needs to be perfectly recovered by receiver 2.
G02.1		2061638958	G02.1_2061638958_4	This more liberal treatment of the non-confidential message is perhaps a more reasonable model than Csiszar and Korneru0027s model where the non-confidential message is required to be decoded by both receivers.
G02.1		2061638958	G02.1_2061638958_5	Measuring ignorance by equivocation rate Re, a single-letter characterization is given of the achievable triples (R1, Re, Rp) where R1 and Rp are respectively the confidential and public message rates.
G02.1		1630749671	G02.1_1630749671_1	A discrete memoryless generalized multiple access channel (GMAC) with confidential messages is studied, where two users attempt to transmit common information to a destination and each user also has private (confidential) information intended for the destination.
G02.1		1630749671	G02.1_1630749671_2	This channel generalizes the multiple access channel (MAC) in that the two users also receive channel outputs.
G02.1		1630749671	G02.1_1630749671_3	It is assumed that each user views the other user as a wire-tapper, and wishes to keep its confidential information as secret as possible from the other user.
G02.1		1630749671	G02.1_1630749671_4	The level of secrecy of the confidential information is measured by the equivocation rate.
G02.1		1630749671	G02.1_1630749671_5	The performance measure of interest is the rate-equivocation tuple that includes the common rate, two private rates and two equivocation rates as components.
G02.1		1630749671	G02.1_1630749671_6	The set that includes all achievable rate-equivocation tuples is referred to as the capacity-equivocation region.
G02.1		1630749671	G02.1_1630749671_7	For the GMAC with one confidential message set, where only one user (user 1) has private (confidential) information for the destination, inner and outer bounds on the capacity-equivocation region are derived.
G02.1		1630749671	G02.1_1630749671_8	The secrecy capacity region is established, which is the set of all achievable rates with user 2 being perfectly ignorant of confidential messages of user 1.
G02.1		1630749671	G02.1_1630749671_9	Furthermore, the capacity-equivocation region and the secrecy capacity region are established for the degraded GMAC with one confidential message set.
G02.1		1630749671	G02.1_1630749671_10	For the GMAC with two confidential message sets, where both users have confidential messages for the destination, inner bounds on the capacity-equivocation region and the secrecy capacity region are obtained.
G02.1		2955466575	G02.1_2955466575_1	In this work, spread spectrum with signal overlapping techniques are used to secure confidential connections against eavesdropping.
G02.1		2955466575	G02.1_2955466575_2	Routing and spectrum allocation algorithms are proposed in order to establish a set of confidential and non-confidential connections in elastic optical networks, while considering spectrum utilization and enhanced security.
G02.1		157865215	G02.1_157865215_1	Using noise multiplied data to protect confidential data has recently drawn some attention.
G02.1		157865215	G02.1_157865215_2	Understanding the probability property of the underlying confidential data based on their masked data is of interest in confidential data analysis.
G02.1		157865215	G02.1_157865215_3	This paper proposes the approach of sample-moment-based density approximant based on noise multiplied data and provides a new manner for approximating the density function of the underlying confidential data without accessing the original data.
G02.1		2107725818	G02.1_2107725818_1	We propose a confidential information gathering system which employs a software agent traversing a list of information resource servers on the Internet to gather confidential information.
G02.1		2107725818	G02.1_2107725818_2	Both software agent technology and cryptographic technology are applied to automate and secure the confidential information gathering process.
G02.1		2092300736	G02.1_2092300736_1	Leveraging the abundant community resources, e.g.
G02.1		2092300736	G02.1_2092300736_2	campus students, programming fans, software amateurs, is promising to be a flexible and effective approach for relieving the enterpriseu0027s IT resource shortage.
G02.1		2092300736	G02.1_2092300736_3	However, the concern about confidential knowledge exposure makes most enterprises hesitate to outsource software development to community resources.
G02.1		2092300736	G02.1_2092300736_4	Unlike the traditional legal protection mechanism that prevents community resources from exposing the already known confidential knowledge, this paper presents a proactive confidential knowledge protection technology, which prevents the community resources from learning the confidential knowledge in software development activities.
G02.1		2092300736	G02.1_2092300736_5	First, the client is facilitated on identifying confidential knowledge involved in the software development activity.
G02.1		2092300736	G02.1_2092300736_6	Then, the risky software design elements that might expose confidential knowledge are identified in both qualitative and quantitative way.
G02.1		2092300736	G02.1_2092300736_7	Based on the identification result, a holistic proactive protection solution is presented by orchestrating task reservation, task pretending and task partition activities.
G02.1		2092300736	G02.1_2092300736_8	Finally, the processed software development tasks are dispatched to community developers without worrying about the confidential knowledge exposure.
G02.1		2092300736	G02.1_2092300736_9	The technology has been preliminarily validated in two community-based software development cases.
G02.1		2140958383	G02.1_2140958383_1	In the confidential computing issues of scientific computing, the confidential computing of matrix factorization is still no fruit home and abroad.
G02.1		2140958383	G02.1_2140958383_2	This paper using Data perturbation assumption and Oblivious Transfer 1 out of k protocol, successfully construct confidential computing protocols of matrix general factorization and QR factorization.
G02.1		2140958383	G02.1_2140958383_3	On the model of semi-honest, it can meet the confidentiality.
G02.1		2140958383	G02.1_2140958383_4	At the same time, the method of this protocol is also suitable for confidential computing of matrix other factorizations.
G02.1		2171235563	G02.1_2171235563_1	In this work, the bidirectional broadcast channel (BBC) with confidential messages is studied.
G02.1		2171235563	G02.1_2171235563_2	The problem is motivated by the concept of bidirectional relaying in a three-node network, where a half-duplex relay node establishes a bidirectional communication between two other nodes using a decode-and-forward protocol and thereby transmits additional confidential information to one of them in the broadcast phase.
G02.1		2171235563	G02.1_2171235563_3	The corresponding confidential message is transmitted at a certain secrecy level which characterizes the amount of information that can be kept secret from the non-legitimate node.
G02.1		2171235563	G02.1_2171235563_4	The capacity-equivocation and secrecy capacity regions of the BBC with confidential messages are established where the latter characterizes the communication scenario with perfect secrecy, which means that the confidential information is completely hidden from the non-legitimate node.
G02.1		2171235563	G02.1_2171235563_5	Thereby, it is shown that the optimal processing exploits ideas and concepts of the BBC with common messages and of the classical broadcast channel with confidential messages.
G02.1		2897812612	G02.1_2897812612_1	Early data leakage protection methods for smart mobile devices usually focus on confidential terms and their context, which truly prevent some kinds of data leakage events.
G02.1		2897812612	G02.1_2897812612_2	However, with the high dimensionality and redundancy of text data, it is difficult to detect the documents which contain confidential contents accurately.
G02.1		2897812612	G02.1_2897812612_3	Our approach updates cluster graph structure based on CBDLP (Data Leakage Protection Based on Context) model by computing the importance of confidential terms and the terms within the range of their context.
G02.1		2897812612	G02.1_2897812612_4	By applying CBDLP with pruning procedure which has been validated, we further remove the redundancy terms and noise terms.
G02.1		2897812612	G02.1_2897812612_5	Actually, not only can confidential terms be accurately detected but also the sophisticated rephrased confidential contents are detected during the experiments.
G02.2		2811012192	G02.2_2811012192_1	With evidence mounting about the proliferation of “fake news” and hate speech online, policymakers around the world are already struggling to address the impact of new technologies on elections and public discourse in democratic societies.
G02.2		2811012192	G02.2_2811012192_2	While the regulatory instinct may be to rein in AI, algorithms, and digital platforms, we should be cautious of knee-jerk reactions to complex public policy dilemmas.
G02.2		2811012192	G02.2_2811012192_3	In this special issue of IEEE Security u0026 Privacy, researchers from across disciplines discuss strategies to prevent a future in which artificial intelligence defeats liberal values, including privacy, equal protection under the law, and due process.
G02.2		2019196873	G02.2_2019196873_1	Encrypting database before stored in cloud storage so far has been the most practical solution for preserving data privacy in an un-trusted cloud environment.
G02.2		2019196873	G02.2_2019196873_2	This, however, makes the operation over database more complicated.
G02.2		2019196873	G02.2_2019196873_3	Even for very simple database operation a cloud user has to retrieve the whole database, decrypt it and then be able to operate on it.
G02.2		2019196873	G02.2_2019196873_4	To reduce the load of such a process, bucketization has been proposed.
G02.2		2019196873	G02.2_2019196873_5	Data in format of tuples with attributes of interest are divided into buckets according to attribute values, and original attribute values are hidden by corresponding bucket indexes.
G02.2		2019196873	G02.2_2019196873_6	When query is executed on bucketized database, only buckets of interest instead of whole database are retrieved.
G02.2		2019196873	G02.2_2019196873_7	However, when tuples have more than one attributes that may be frequently operated on, bucketization with a single data format has both privacy and performance concerns.
G02.2		2019196873	G02.2_2019196873_8	In this paper we propose a comprehensive data bucketization scheme that considers privacy, access performance, and back-up efficiency.
G02.2		2019196873	G02.2_2019196873_9	Instead of having a single-formatted data, cloud keeps heterogeneously constructed hard data copies.
G02.2		2019196873	G02.2_2019196873_10	Each copy is bucketized and stored according to one specified attribute.
G02.2		2019196873	G02.2_2019196873_11	The scheme can protect the privacy leakage from a joint distribution among attributes of interests, and guarantees an even access speed when storage access is proceeded according to different data attributes.
G02.2		2019196873	G02.2_2019196873_12	Since multiple copies of data are stored in cloud, we further design a fine-grained, private inter-backup between heterogeneous copies.
G02.2		137738462	G02.2_137738462_1	Web search engines are tools employed to find specific information in the Internet.
G02.2		137738462	G02.2_137738462_2	However, they also represent a threat for the privacy of their users.
G02.2		137738462	G02.2_137738462_3	This happens because the web search engines store and analyze the personal information that the users reveal in their queries.
G02.2		137738462	G02.2_137738462_4	In order to avoid this privacy threat, it is necessary to provide mechanisms that protect the users of these tools.
G02.2		795404324	G02.2_795404324_1	Low emission zones (LEZs) aim to reduce pollution and traffic congestion in cities.
G02.2		795404324	G02.2_795404324_2	Current proposals for managing LEZs introduce a significant error percentage in the detection of fraudulent drivers and represent a serious privacy threat for the honest ones.
G02.2		795404324	G02.2_795404324_3	In this article, a new electronic toll system to improve both issues is proposed.
G02.2		2408306113	G02.2_2408306113_1	"The General Data Protection Regulation introduces a brand new right to data portability that should enable the data subject ""to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the data have been provided""."
G02.2		2408306113	G02.2_2408306113_2	This brief paper enucleates the legal and technical limitations to this new right: without standards which lead to interoperability the right to data portability is destined to remain more a declaration of principle than a real and effective tool for individual self-determination in the digital environment.
G02.2		2338029724	G02.2_2338029724_1	Free content and services on the Web are often supported by ads.
G02.2		2338029724	G02.2_2338029724_2	However, with the proliferation of intrusive and privacy-invasive ads, a significant proportion of users have started to use ad blockers.
G02.2		2338029724	G02.2_2338029724_3	As existing ad blockers are radical (they block all ads) and are not designed taking into account their economic impact, ad-based economic model of the Web is in danger today.
G02.2		2338029724	G02.2_2338029724_4	":[62],""this paper, we target privacy-sensitive users and provide them with fine-grained control over tracking."
G02.2		2338029724	G02.2_2338029724_5	Our working assumption is that some categories of web pages (for example, related to health, religion, etc.)
G02.2		2338029724	G02.2_2338029724_6	are more privacy-sensitive to users than others (education, science, etc.).
G02.2		2338029724	G02.2_2338029724_7	Therefore, our proposed approach consists in providing users with an option to specify the categories of web pages that are privacy-sensitive to them and block trackers present on such web pages only.
G02.2		2338029724	G02.2_2338029724_8	As tracking is prevented by blocking network connections of third-party domains, we avoid not only tracking but also third-party ads.
G02.2		2338029724	G02.2_2338029724_9	Since users will continue receiving ads on web pages belonging to non-sensitive categories, our approach essentially provides a trade-off between privacy and economy.
G02.2		2338029724	G02.2_2338029724_10	To test the viability of our solution, we implemented it as a Google Chrome extension, named MyTrackingChoices (available on Chrome Web Store).
G02.2		2338029724	G02.2_2338029724_11	Our real-world experiments with MyTrackingChoices show that the economic impact of ad blocking exerted by privacy-sensitive users can be significantly reduced.
G02.2		2072485966	G02.2_2072485966_1	This paper reviews literature published in oncology and toxicology journals between 1990 and 2006 addressing the effects of implanted radio-frequency (RFID) microchips on laboratory rodents and dogs.
G02.2		2072485966	G02.2_2072485966_2	Eleven articles were reviewed in all, with eight investigating mice and rats, and three investigating dogs.
G02.2		2072485966	G02.2_2072485966_3	In all but three of the articles, researchers observed that malignant sarcomas and other cancers formed around or adjacent to the implanted microchips.
G02.2		2072485966	G02.2_2072485966_4	The tumors developed in both experimental and control animals, and in two household pets.
G02.2		2072485966	G02.2_2072485966_5	In nearly all cases, researchers concluded that the microchips had induced the cancers.
G02.2		2072485966	G02.2_2072485966_6	Possible explanations for the tumors are explored, and a set of recommendations for policy makers, human patients and their doctors, veterinarians, pet owners, and oncology researchers is presented in light of these findings.
G02.2		2021351590	G02.2_2021351590_1	Classifying data according to its permissible use, appropriate handling, and business value is critical for data privacy and security protection.
G02.2		2021351590	G02.2_2021351590_2	This is essential for compliance with the constantly evolving regulatory landscape concerning protected data.
G02.2		2021351590	G02.2_2021351590_3	Problems arise when users compromise data privacy and security by overlooking the critical need to manage data according to these requirements.
G02.2		2021351590	G02.2_2021351590_4	This paper considers the creation and application of data classification systems for security and privacy purposes.
G02.2		2021351590	G02.2_2021351590_5	It focuses primarily on classifying information in a meaningful way through the use of a partially automated methodology that normalizes and classifies structured data throughout an enterprise.
G02.2		2021351590	G02.2_2021351590_6	We introduce the three pillars of the data-centric security model, which are based on the data-centric security classification offering by IBM Global Business Services (GBS) and the IBM Research Division.
G02.2		2021351590	G02.2_2021351590_7	In particular, we describe the data classification pillar of the data-centric security architecture, which provides the framework and method for partially automated classification of data to meet the demands of compliance standards.
G02.2		2088234260	G02.2_2088234260_1	When technology and personal information intersect; as they will in areas such as cloud computing, business intelligence and smart interactions, privacy issues arise.
G02.2		2088234260	G02.2_2088234260_2	Protecting privacy provides technology companies with a competitive advantage -- good privacy is good business.
G02.2		2047503886	G02.2_2047503886_1	Recommender systems play a crucial role today in on-line applications as they improve the customer satisfaction, and at the same time results in an increase in the profit for the service provider.
G02.2		2047503886	G02.2_2047503886_2	However, there are serious privacy concerns as such systems rely on the personal data of the customers.
G02.2		2047503886	G02.2_2047503886_3	There have been several proposals to provide privacy in recommender systems and, among many others, cryptographic techniques provide effective ways of protecting privacy-sensitive data of the customers.
G02.2		2047503886	G02.2_2047503886_4	Unfortunately, existing methods only consider a static environment with constant number of customers in the system, which can be abused to extract more information on the customers when a cryptography based protocol is executed repeatedly.
G02.2		2047503886	G02.2_2047503886_5	In this paper, we provide a privacy-preserving recommender system for a dynamic environment, which is more suitable for the real world applications.
G02.2		2164021672	G02.2_2164021672_1	In recent times online social networks (OSN) have become one of the most widely used Internet applications with a very large number of users.
G02.2		2164021672	G02.2_2164021672_2	In an OSN, the users exchange information via text, pictures and videos with their peers/friends for their personal or business interests.
G02.2		2164021672	G02.2_2164021672_3	Since the information that flows across an OSN is generally of personal in nature, it is important that the users get assurance regarding their information is kept private to a level that they desire.
G02.2		2164021672	G02.2_2164021672_4	In this paper, we analyze the potential problems with centralized OSNs and Distributed OSNs and then suggest an integrated framework which combines the advantages of these two frameworks and at the same time eliminates their drawbacks.
G02.2		2164021672	G02.2_2164021672_5	The proposal is to have a framework with the familiar interface and applications that of the centralized OSNs and access control over the personal data like that of Distributed OSN.

G04.1		1980969309	G04.1_1980969309_3	The database provides the all-atom description of the protein, its ligand, their binding site and their binding mode.
G04.1		1980969309	G04.1_1980969309_4	Currently, the sc-PDB archive registers 9283 binding sites from 3678 unique proteins and 5608 unique ligands.
G04.1		1980969309	G04.1_1980969309_5	The sc-PDB database was publicly launched in 2004 with the aim of providing structure files suitable for computational approaches to drug design, such as docking.
G04.1		1980969309	G04.1_1980969309_6	During the last 10 years we have improved and standardized the processes for (i) identifying binding sites, (ii) correcting structures, (iii) annotating protein function and ligand properties and (iv) characterizing their binding mode.
G04.1		1980969309	G04.1_1980969309_7	This paper presents the latest enhancements in the database, specifically pertaining to the representation of molecular interaction and to the similarity between ligand/protein binding patterns.
G04.1		1980969309	G04.1_1980969309_8	The new website puts emphasis in pictorial analysis of data.
G04.1		2014595039	G04.1_2014595039_1	Chemogenomics has emerged as an interdisciplinary field that aims to ultimately identify all possible ligands of all target families in a systematic manner.
G04.1		2014595039	G04.1_2014595039_2	An ever-increasing need to explore the vast space of both ligands and targets has recently triggered the development of novel computational techniques for chemogenomics, which have the potential to play a crucial role in drug discovery.
G04.1		2014595039	G04.1_2014595039_3	Among others, a kernel-based machine learning approach has attracted increasing attention.
G04.1		2014595039	G04.1_2014595039_4	Here, we explore the applicability of several ligand-target kernels by extensively evaluating the prediction performance of ligand-target interactions on five target families, and reveal how different combinations of ligand kernels and protein kernels affect the performance and also how the performance varies between the target families.
G04.1		1576736171	G04.1_1576736171_1	Deformation based morphometry is used to detect differences in in-vivo Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) of the mouse brain obtained from two transgenic strains: TASTPM mice that over-express proteins associated with Alzheimeru0027s disease, and wild-type mice.
G04.1		1576736171	G04.1_1576736171_2	MRI was carried out at four time points.
G04.1		1576736171	G04.1_1576736171_3	We compare two different methods to detect group differences in the longitudinal and cross-sectional data.
G04.1		1576736171	G04.1_1576736171_4	Both methods are based on non-rigid registration of the images to a mouse brain atlas.
G04.1		1576736171	G04.1_1576736171_5	The whole brain volume measurements on 27 TASTPM and wild-type animals are reproducible to within 0.4% of whole brain volume.
G04.1		1576736171	G04.1_1576736171_6	The agreement between different methods for measuring volumes in a serial study is shown.
G04.1		1576736171	G04.1_1576736171_7	The ability to quantify changes in growth between strains in whole brain, hippocampus and cerebral cortex is demonstrated.
G04.1		2787365104	G04.1_2787365104_1	Tumors consist of a hierarchical population of cells that differ in their phenotype and genotype.
G04.1		2787365104	G04.1_2787365104_2	This hierarchical organization of cells means that a few clones (i.e., cells and several generations of offspring) are abundant while most are rare, which is called clonal dominance.
G04.1		2787365104	G04.1_2787365104_3	Such dominance also occurred in published in vitro iterated growth and passage experiments with tumor cells in which genetic barcodes were used for lineage tracing.
G04.1		2787365104	G04.1_2787365104_4	A potential source for such heterogeneity is that dominant clones derive from cancer stem cells with an unlimited self-renewal capacity.
G04.1		2787365104	G04.1_2787365104_5	Furthermore, ongoing evolution and selection within the growing population may also induce clonal dominance.
G04.1		2787365104	G04.1_2787365104_6	To understand how clonal dominance developed in the iterated growth and passage experiments, we built a computational model that accurately simulates these experiments.
G04.1		2787365104	G04.1_2787365104_7	The model simulations reproduced the clonal dominance that developed in in vitro iterated growth and passage experiments when the division rates vary between cells, due to a combination of initial variation and of ongoing mutational processes.
G04.1		2787365104	G04.1_2787365104_8	In contrast, the experimental results can neither be reproduced with a model that considers random growth and passage, nor with a model based on cancer stem cells.
G04.1		2787365104	G04.1_2787365104_9	Altogether, our model suggests that in vitro clonal dominance develops due to selection of fast-dividing clones.

G04.1		2024010567	G04.1_2024010567_1	Abstract   Pharmacological MRI (phMRI) methods map the hemodynamic response to drug challenge as a surrogate for changes in neuronal activity.
G04.1		2024010567	G04.1_2024010567_2	However, the central effects of drugs can be complex and include activity at the primary site of action, downstream effects in other brain regions and direct effects on vasculature and neurovascular coupling.
G04.1		2024010567	G04.1_2024010567_3	Univariate analysis, normally applied to phMRI data, does not discriminate between these effects, and can result in anatomically non-specific activation patterns.
G04.1		2024010567	G04.1_2024010567_4	We analysed inter-subject correlations in the amplitude of the slow phMRI response to map functionally connected brain regions recruited in response to pharmacological challenge.
G04.1		2024010567	G04.1_2024010567_5	Application of  d -amphetamine and fluoxetine revealed well-defined functional structure underlying the widespread signal changes detected via standard methods.
G04.1		2024010567	G04.1_2024010567_6	Correlated responses were found to delineate key neurotransmitter pathways selectively targeted by these drugs, corroborating a tight correspondence between the phMRI response and changes in neurotransmitter systems specific to the pharmacological action.
G04.1		2024010567	G04.1_2024010567_7	In vivo mapping of correlated responses in this way greatly extends the range of information available from phMRI studies and provides a new window into the function of neurotransmitter systems in the active state.
G04.1		2024010567	G04.1_2024010567_8	This approach may provide new important insights regarding the central systems underlying pharmacological action.
G04.1		2921307297	G04.1_2921307297_1	Recent progress in molecular biology has revealed that many non-coding RNAs regulate gene expression or catalyze biochemical reactions in tumors, viruses and several other diseases.
G04.1		2921307297	G04.1_2921307297_2	The tertiary structure of RNA molecules and RNA–RNA/protein interaction sites are of increasing importance as potential targets for new medicines that treat a broad array of human diseases.
G04.1		2921307297	G04.1_2921307297_3	Current RNA drugs are split into two groups: antisense RNA molecules and aptamers.
G04.1		2921307297	G04.1_2921307297_4	In this report, we present a novel workflow to predict RNA tertiary structures and RNA–RNA/protein interactions using the KNIME environment, which enabled us to assemble a combination of RNA-related analytical tools and databases.
G04.1		2921307297	G04.1_2921307297_5	In this study, three analytical workflows for comprehensive structural analysis of RNA are introduced: (1) prediction of the tertiary structure of RNA; (2) prediction of the structure of RNA–RNA complexes and analysis of their interactions; and (3) prediction of the structure of RNA–protein complexes and analysis of their interactions.
G04.1		2921307297	G04.1_2921307297_6	In an RNA–protein case study, we modeled the tertiary structure of pegaptanib, an aptamer drug, and performed docking calculations of the pegaptanib-vascular endothelial growth factor complex using a fragment of the interaction site of the aptamer.
G04.1		2921307297	G04.1_2921307297_7	We also present molecular dynamics simulations of the RNA–protein complex to evaluate the affinity of the complex by mutating bases at the interaction interface.
G04.1		2921307297	G04.1_2921307297_8	The results provide valuable information for designing novel features of aptamer-protein complexes.
G04.1		2947161483	G04.1_2947161483_1	Over the last 5 years deep learning has progressed tremendously in both image recognition and natural language processing.
G04.1		2947161483	G04.1_2947161483_2	Now it is increasingly applied to other data rich fields.
G04.1		2947161483	G04.1_2947161483_3	In drug discovery, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been shown to be an effective method to generate novel chemical structures in the form of SMILES.
G04.1		2947161483	G04.1_2947161483_4	However, ligands generated by current methods have so far provided relatively low diversity and do not fully cover the whole chemical space occupied by known ligands.
G04.1		2947161483	G04.1_2947161483_5	Here, we propose a new method (DrugEx) to discover de novo drug-like molecules.
G04.1		2947161483	G04.1_2947161483_6	DrugEx is an RNN model (generator) trained through reinforcement learning which was integrated with a special exploration strategy.
G04.1		2947161483	G04.1_2947161483_7	As a case study we applied our method to design ligands against the adenosine A2A receptor.
G04.1		2947161483	G04.1_2947161483_8	From ChEMBL data, a machine learning model (predictor) was created to predict whether generated molecules are active or not.
G04.1		2947161483	G04.1_2947161483_9	Based on this predictor as the reward function, the generator was trained by reinforcement learning without any further data.
G04.1		2947161483	G04.1_2947161483_10	We then compared the performance of our method with two previously published methods, REINVENT and ORGANIC.
G04.1		2947161483	G04.1_2947161483_11	We found that candidate molecules our model designed, and predicted to be active, had a larger chemical diversity and better covered the chemical space of known ligands compared to the state-of-the-art.
G04.1		2107559698	G04.1_2107559698_1	Background: Glucocorticoids are potent anti-inflammatory agents used for the treatment of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis.
G04.1		2107559698	G04.1_2107559698_2	Unfortunately, usage is limited because of metabolic sideeffects, e.g.
G04.1		2107559698	G04.1_2107559698_3	insulin resistance, glucose intolerance and diabetes.
G04.1		2107559698	G04.1_2107559698_4	To gain more insight into the mechanisms behind glucocorticoid induced insulin resistance, it is important to understand which genes play a role in the development of insulin resistance and which genes are affected by glucocorticoids.
G04.1		2107559698	G04.1_2107559698_5	Medline abstracts contain many studies about insulin resistance and the molecular effects of glucocorticoids and thus are a good resource to study these effects.
G04.1		2107559698	G04.1_2107559698_6	Results: We developed CoPubGene a method to automatically identify gene-disease associations in Medline abstracts.
G04.1		2107559698	G04.1_2107559698_7	We used this method to create a literature network of genes related to insulin resistance and to evaluate the importance of the genes in this network for glucocorticoid induced metabolic side effects and anti-inflammatory processes.

G04.1		2884922228	G04.1_2884922228_2	Systematic experiments tracking disease progression at gene level are usually conducted giving a temporal microarray data.
G04.1		2884922228	G04.1_2884922228_3	There is a need for developing methods to analyze such complex data and extract important proteins which could be involved in temporal progression of the data and hence progression of the disease.

G04.1		2162000047	G04.1_2162000047_2	Natural products or their derivatives have provided more than 50% of all existing drugs, offering a chemically diverse space for discovery of novel drugs.
G04.1		2769643022	G04.1_2769643022_1	G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play crucial roles in cell physiology and pathophysiology.
G04.1		2769643022	G04.1_2769643022_2	There is increasing interest in using structural information for virtual screening (VS) of libraries and for structure-based drug design to identify novel agonist or antagonist leads.
G04.1		2769643022	G04.1_2769643022_3	However, the sparse availability of experimentally determined GPCR/ligand complex structures with diverse ligands impedes the application of structure-based drug design (SBDD) programs directed to identifying new molecules with a select pharmacology.
G04.1		2769643022	G04.1_2769643022_4	In this study, we apply ligand-directed modeling (LDM) to available GPCR X-ray structures to improve VS performance and selectivity towards molecules of specific pharmacological profile.
G04.1		2769643022	G04.1_2769643022_5	The described method refines a GPCR binding pocket conformation using a single known ligand for that GPCR.
G04.1		2769643022	G04.1_2769643022_6	The LDM method is a computationally efficient, iterative workflow consisting of protein sampling and ligand docking.
G04.1		2769643022	G04.1_2769643022_7	We developed an extensive benchmark comparing LDM-refined binding pockets to GPCR X-ray crystal structures across seven different GPCRs bound to a range of ligands of different chemotypes and pharmacological profiles.
G04.1		2769643022	G04.1_2769643022_8	LDM-refined models showed improvement in VS performance over origin X-ray crystal structures in 21 out of 24 cases.
G04.1		2769643022	G04.1_2769643022_9	In all cases, the LDM-refined models had superior performance in enriching for the chemotype of the refinement ligand.
G04.1		2769643022	G04.1_2769643022_10	This likely contributes to the LDM success in all cases of inhibitor-bound to agonist-bound binding pocket refinement, a key task for GPCR SBDD programs.
G04.1		2769643022	G04.1_2769643022_11	Indeed, agonist ligands are required for a plethora of GPCRs for therapeutic intervention, however GPCR X-ray structures are mostly restricted to their inactive inhibitor-bound state.
G04.1		1982888507	G04.1_1982888507_1	The cannabinoid CB1 receptor is a class A G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is the most widely expressed GPCR in the brain.
G04.1		1982888507	G04.1_1982888507_2	Many GPCRs contain allosteric binding sites for endogenous and/or synthetic ligands, which are topographically distinct from the agonist-binding site that is known as the orthosteric site.
G04.1		1982888507	G04.1_1982888507_3	While both endogenous and synthetic ligands that act at the CB1 orthosteric site have been known for some time, compounds that act at a CB1 allosteric site have only recently been discovered.
G04.1		1982888507	G04.1_1982888507_4	The most studied of these is 5-chloro-3-ethyl-1H-indole-2-carboxylic acid [2-(4-piperidin-1-ylphenyl)ethyl]amide (Org27569).
G04.1		1982888507	G04.1_1982888507_5	Because allosteric ligands are thought to act through conformational changes in the receptor that are transmitted from the allosteric to the orthosteric site, computational studies of the structural and dynamic interactions of Org27569 with the CB1 receptor are crucial to achieve a molecular level understanding of the basis of action of this important new class of compounds.
G04.1		1982888507	G04.1_1982888507_6	To date, such computational studies have not been possible due to the lack of a complete set of molecular mechanics force field parameters for Org27569.
G04.1		1982888507	G04.1_1982888507_7	Here, we present the development of missing CHARMM force field parameters for Org27569 using previously published methods and the validation and application of these new parameters using normal mode analysis and molecular dynamics simulations combined with experimental infrared measurements.

G04.1		2883998789	G04.1_2883998789_1	Abstract   Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family members plays a vital role in regulating hormonal function, bone formation, tissue remodeling, and erythropoiesis, cell growth and apoptosis.
G04.1		2883998789	G04.1_2883998789_2	TGF-β super-family members mediate signal transduction via serine/threonine kinase receptors located on the cell membrane.
G04.1		2883998789	G04.1_2883998789_3	Variation in expression of the TGF-β type I and II receptors in the cancer cells compromise its tumor suppressor activities which direct to oncogenic functions.
G04.1		2883998789	G04.1_2883998789_4	The present study was aimed to screen the potent TGF-β type I inhibitors through atom based 3D-QSAR and pharmacophore modelling.
G04.1		2883998789	G04.1_2883998789_5	For this purpose, we have chosen known TGF-β type I inhibitors from the binding database.
G04.1		2883998789	G04.1_2883998789_6	The PHASE module of Schrodinger identified the best Pharmacophore model which includes three hydrogen bond acceptors (A), one hydrophobic region (H), and one ring (R) as the structural features.
G04.1		2883998789	G04.1_2883998789_7	The top pharmacophore model AAAHR.27 was chosen with the R2 value of 0.94 and validated externally using molecules of the test set.
G04.1		2883998789	G04.1_2883998789_8	Moreover the AAAHR.27 model underwent virtual screening using the molecules from the NCI, ZINC and Maybridge database.
G04.1		2883998789	G04.1_2883998789_9	The screened molecules were further filtered using molecular docking and ADME properties prediction.
G04.1		2883998789	G04.1_2883998789_10	Additionally, the 7 lead molecules were compared with a newly identified compound “SB431542” (well known TGF-β type I receptor inhibitor) and Galunisertib, a small molecule inhibitor of TGF-β type I, under clinical development (phase II trials) using the docking score and other binding properties.
G04.1		2883998789	G04.1_2883998789_11	Also a top scored screened molecule from our study has been compared and confirmed using molecular dynamic simulation studies.
G04.1		2883998789	G04.1_2883998789_12	By this way, we have obtained 7 distinct drug-like TGF-β type I inhibitors which can be beneficial in suppressing cancers reported with up-regulation of TGF-β type I.
G04.1		2883998789	G04.1_2883998789_13	This result highlights the guidelines for designing molecules with TGF-β Type I inhibitory properties.
G04.1		1607661534	G04.1_1607661534_1	A non-covalent interaction force field model derived from the partition coefficient of 1-octanol/water solubility is described.
G04.1		1607661534	G04.1_1607661534_2	This model, HINT for Hydropathic INTeractions, is shown to include, in very empirical and approximate terms, all components of biomolecular associations, including hydrogen bonding, Coulombic interactions, hydrophobic interactions, entropy and solvation/desolvation.
G04.1		1607661534	G04.1_1607661534_3	Particular emphasis is placed on: (1) demonstrating the relationship between the total empirical HINT score and free energy of association, ΔGinteraction; (2) showing that the HINT hydrophobic-polar interaction sub-score represents the energy cost of desolvation upon binding for interacting biomolecules; and (3) a new methodology for treating constrained water molecules as discrete independent small ligands.
G04.1		1607661534	G04.1_1607661534_4	An example calculation is reported for dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) bound with methotrexate (MTX).
G04.1		1607661534	G04.1_1607661534_5	In that case the observed very tight binding, ΔGinteraction≤−13.6 kcal mol−1, is largely due to ten hydrogen bonds between the ligand and enzyme with estimated strength ranging between −0.4 and −2.3 kcal mol−1.
G04.1		1607661534	G04.1_1607661534_6	Four water molecules bridging between DHFR and MTX contribute an additional −1.7 kcal mol−1 stability to the complex.
G04.1		1607661534	G04.1_1607661534_7	The HINT estimate of the cost of desolvation is +13.9 kcal mol−1.
G04.2		2518969260	G04.2_2518969260_1	Motivation: In biomedicine, every molecular measurement is relative to a reference point, like a fixed aliquot of RNA extracted from a tissue, a defined number of blood cells, or a defined volume of biofluid.
G04.2		2518969260	G04.2_2518969260_2	Reference points are often chosen for practical reasons.
G04.2		2518969260	G04.2_2518969260_3	For example, we might want to assess the metabolome of a diseased organ but can only measure metabolites in blood or urine.

G04.2		2518969260	G04.2_2518969260_6	Results: Here, we show that reference point discrepancies compromise the performance of regression models like the LASSO.
G04.2		2518969260	G04.2_2518969260_7	As an alternative, we suggest zero-sum regression for a reference point insensitive analysis.
G04.2		2518969260	G04.2_2518969260_8	We show that zero-sum regression is superior to the LASSO in case of a poor choice of reference point both in simulations and in an application that integrates intestinal microbiome analysis with metabolomics.
G04.2		2518969260	G04.2_2518969260_9	Moreover, we describe a novel coordinate descent based algorithm to fit zero-sum elastic nets.

G04.2		2151305645	G04.2_2151305645_3	Known RNA edited substrates suggest, however, that site selective A-to-I editing is particularly important for normal brain development in mammals.
G04.2		88353557	G04.2_88353557_1	Systems Biology starts by defining the components of a biological system and collecting the relevant previous biochemical and genetic data on a global scale, using high throughput platforms, formulating an initial model of the system, systematically perturbing the components of the system, and analysing the results.
G04.2		88353557	G04.2_88353557_2	By comparing the observed responses to those predicted by the model, it is then possible to iteratively refine the model so that its prediction fit best to the experimental observations.
G04.2		88353557	G04.2_88353557_3	Finally, new experimental perturbations are conceived and tested in order to distinguish between the multiple competing hypotheses.We discuss the computational methods used for high throughput data collection in functional genomics, emphasizing the strong need for standardization and quality assurance.
G04.2		88353557	G04.2_88353557_4	We then review the computational needs required for biological system modeling and semantic integration in the systemic framework, arguing that the Unified Modeling Language (UML) seems appropriate to support the iterative process of Systems Biology.

G04.2		2131898642	G04.2_2131898642_2	Decoupling the two types of movements to enable accurate classification of the particle motion requires the application of registration algorithms.
G04.2		2131898642	G04.2_2131898642_3	We have developed an intensity-based approach for nonrigid registration of multichannel microscopy image sequences of cell nuclei.
G04.2		2131898642	G04.2_2131898642_4	First, based on 3-D synthetic images we demonstrate that cell nucleus deformations change the observed motion types of particles and that our approach allows to recover the original motion.
G04.2		2131898642	G04.2_2131898642_5	Second, we have successfully applied our approach to register 2-D and 3-D real microscopy image sequences.
G04.2		2131898642	G04.2_2131898642_6	A quantitative experimental comparison with previous approaches for nonrigid registration of cell microscopy has also been performed.
G04.2		2141694506	G04.2_2141694506_1	Fluorescence time-lapse microscopy is a powerful technique for observing the spatial-temporal behavior of viruses.
G04.2		2141694506	G04.2_2141694506_2	To quantitatively analyze the exhibited dynamical relationships, tracking of viruses over time is required.
G04.2		2141694506	G04.2_2141694506_3	We have developed probabilistic approaches based on particle filters for tracking multiple virus particles in time-lapse fluorescence microscopy images.
G04.2		2141694506	G04.2_2141694506_4	We employ a mixture of particle filters as well as independent particle filters.
G04.2		2141694506	G04.2_2141694506_5	For the latter, we have developed a penalization strategy to maintain the identity of the tracked objects in cases where objects are in close proximity.
G04.2		2141694506	G04.2_2141694506_6	We have also extended the approaches for tracking in multi-channel microscopy image sequences.
G04.2		2141694506	G04.2_2141694506_7	The approaches have been evaluated based on synthetic images and the performance has been quantified.
G04.2		2141694506	G04.2_2141694506_8	We have also successfully applied the approaches to real microscopy images of HIV-1 particles and have compared the tracking results with ground truth from manual tracking.

G04.2		1975981804	G04.2_1975981804_2	Here, using our algorithm PicTar, we exploit cross-species comparisons to predict, on average, 54 targeted genes per microRNA above noise in Drosophila melanogaster.
G04.2		1975981804	G04.2_1975981804_3	Analysis of the functional annotation of target genes furthermore suggests specific biological functions for many microRNAs.
G04.2		1975981804	G04.2_1975981804_4	We also predict combinatorial targets for clustered microRNAs and find that some clustered microRNAs are likely to coordinately regulate target genes.
G04.2		1975981804	G04.2_1975981804_5	Furthermore, we compare microRNA regulation between insects and vertebrates.
G04.2		1975981804	G04.2_1975981804_6	We find that the widespread extent of gene regulation by microRNAs is comparable between flies and mammals but that certain microRNAs may function in clade-specific modes of gene regulation.
G04.2		1975981804	G04.2_1975981804_7	One of these microRNAs (miR-210) is predicted to contribute to the regulation of fly oogenesis.

G04.2		1975981804	G04.2_1975981804_9	Our findings provide the most extensive microRNA target predictions in Drosophila to date, suggest specific functional roles for most microRNAs, indicate the existence of coordinate gene regulation executed by clustered microRNAs, and shed light on the evolution of microRNA function across large evolutionary distances.

G04.2		1985479195	G04.2_1985479195_3	To automatically identify fusion for single particles based on their intensity over time, we have developed a layered probabilistic approach.
G04.2		1985479195	G04.2_1985479195_4	The approach decomposes the action of a single particle into three abstractions: the intensity over time, the underlying temporal intensity model, as well as a high level behavior.
G04.2		1985479195	G04.2_1985479195_5	Each abstraction corresponds to a layer and these layers are represented via stochastic hybrid systems and hidden Markov models.
G04.2		1985479195	G04.2_1985479195_6	We use a maxbelief strategy to efficiently combine both representations.
G04.2		1985479195	G04.2_1985479195_7	To compute estimates for the abstractions we use a hybrid particle filter and the Viterbi algorithm.
G04.2		1985479195	G04.2_1985479195_8	Based on synthetic image sequences, we characterize the performance of the approach as a function of the image noise.
G04.2		1985479195	G04.2_1985479195_9	We also characterize the performance as a function of the tracking error.
G04.2		1985479195	G04.2_1985479195_10	We have also successfully applied the approach to real image sequences displaying pseudotyped HIV-1 particles in contact with host cells and compared the experimental results with ground truth obtained by manual analysis.

G04.2		2190523698	G04.2_2190523698_2	miRNA biogenesis has been studied in animals and plants, recently elucidating more complex aspects, such as non-conserved, species-specific, and heterogeneous miRNA precursor populations.
G04.2		2190523698	G04.2_2190523698_3	Small RNA sequencing data can help in computationally identifying genomic loci of miRNA precursors.
G04.2		2190523698	G04.2_2190523698_4	The challenge is to predict a valid miRNA precursor from inhomogeneous read coverage from a complex RNA library: while the mature miRNA typically produces many sequence reads, the remaining part of the precursor is covered very sparsely.
G04.2		2190523698	G04.2_2190523698_5	As recent results suggest, alternative miRNA biogenesis pathways may lead to a more diverse miRNA precursor population than previously assumed.
G04.2		2190523698	G04.2_2190523698_6	In plants, the latter manifests itself in e.g.
G04.2		2190523698	G04.2_2190523698_7	complex secondary structures and expression from multiple loci within precursors.
G04.2		2190523698	G04.2_2190523698_8	Current miRNA identification algorithms often depend on already existing gene annotation, and/or make use of specific miRNA precursor features such as precursor lengths, secondary structures etc.
G04.2		2190523698	G04.2_2190523698_9	Consequently and in view of the emerging new understanding of a more complex miRNA biogenesis in plants, current tools may fail to characterise organism-specific and heterogeneous miRNA populations.

G04.2		2083559578	G04.2_2083559578_1	A systematic phylogenetic footprinting approach was performed to identify conserved transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) in mammalian promoter regions using human, mouse and rat sequence alignments.
G04.2		2083559578	G04.2_2083559578_2	We found that the score distributions of most binding site models did not follow the Gaussian distribution required by many statistical methods.
G04.2		2083559578	G04.2_2083559578_3	Therefore, we performed an empirical test to establish the optimal threshold for each model.
G04.2		2083559578	G04.2_2083559578_4	We gauged our computational predictions by comparing with previously known TFBSs in the PCK1 gene promoter of the cytosolic isoform of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and achieved a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of approximately 32%.
G04.2		2083559578	G04.2_2083559578_5	Almost all known sites overlapped with predicted sites, and several new putative TFBSs were also identified.
G04.2		2083559578	G04.2_2083559578_6	We validated a predicted SP1 binding site in the control of PCK1 transcription using gel shift and reporter assays.

G04.2		2969233863	G04.2_2969233863_1	Abstract   This study aimed to explore the neural correlates of the embodied metaphor “breaking the rules” and how it affects creativity by using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).
G04.2		2969233863	G04.2_2969233863_2	To embody the metaphor “breaking the rules,” we created a circumstance in which participants can experience “breaking the walls” through virtual reality (VR) technology.
G04.2		2969233863	G04.2_2969233863_3	Participants were randomly assigned to three conditions: the “break-wall” condition, where they broke the walls to move forward; the “auto-wall” condition, where the barrier wall opened automatically; and the “no-wall” condition, where no barrier walls appeared.
G04.2		2969233863	G04.2_2969233863_4	While walking in the virtual scenes, participants were asked to solve a creativity-demanding problem and to wear the fNIRS device to record their neural activities.
G04.2		2969233863	G04.2_2969233863_5	It was found that participants showed better creative performance in the “break-wall” condition than in the other conditions.
G04.2		2969233863	G04.2_2969233863_6	Weaker activations were found in the frontopolar cortex, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the somatosensory association cortex under the “break-wall” condition, which may be associated with rule-breaking behaviors, creative performance, and sense of embodiment.
G04.2		2969233863	G04.2_2969233863_7	These findings may indicate that physical actions of “breaking the wall” activate the conceptual metaphor of “breaking the rules,” which triggers brain activities related to rule-breaking, thus affecting creative performance.
G04.2		2125909024	G04.2_2125909024_1	The analysis of fluorescently tagged proteins in live cells from multi-channel microscopy image sequences requires a registration to a reference frame to decouple the movement and deformation of cells from the movement of proteins.
G04.2		2125909024	G04.2_2125909024_2	We have developed an intensity-based approach to register 2D and 3D multi-channel microscopy image sequences.
G04.2		2125909024	G04.2_2125909024_3	This approach directly exploits the image intensities.
G04.2		2125909024	G04.2_2125909024_4	We have compared the results of our approach with results based on segmented images.
G04.2		2125909024	G04.2_2125909024_5	Also, we have performed a comparison between a direct registration scheme to the reference frame and an incremental scheme taking into account results from preceding time steps.
G04.2		2125909024	G04.2_2125909024_6	We have validated our approach based on 3D synthetic images of a simulated cell with known deformation which has been calculated based on an analytic solution of the Navier equation given certain boundary conditions.

G04.2		2955648521	G04.2_2955648521_2	Instead, cancer progression models use co-occurence patterns in cross-sectional data to infer epistatic interactions between events and thereby uncover their most likely order of occurence.
G04.2		2955648521	G04.2_2955648521_3	"State-of-the-art progression models, however, are limited by mathematical tractability and only allow events to interact in directed acyclic graphs, to promote but not inhibit subsequent events, or to be mutually exclusive in distinct groups that cannot  :[88],""Here we propose Mutual Hazard Networks (MHN), a new Machine Learning algorithm to infer cyclic progression models from cross-sectional data."

G04.2		2008378689	G04.2_2008378689_1	In comprehensive functional genomics projects, systematic analysis of phenotypes is vital.
G04.2		2008378689	G04.2_2008378689_2	However, conventional phenotypic screening is done mainly by imprecise visual observation of qualitative traits, and, therefore, in silico screening techniques for quantitative traits are required.
G04.2		2008378689	G04.2_2008378689_3	In this report, we propose in silico phenotypic screening method that utilizes a Gaussian mixture model for the trait distribution in the offspring of a mutagenized line and the likelihood ratio test between the estimated Gaussian mixture model and the wild-type single Gaussian model.
G04.2		2008378689	G04.2_2008378689_4	In order to evaluate the proposed method, we performed a screening experiment using real trait data of Arabidopsis.
G04.2		2008378689	G04.2_2008378689_5	In this experiment, the proposed screening method properly distinguished the mutant line from the wild-type line.
G04.2		2008378689	G04.2_2008378689_6	Furthermore, we conducted power analysis of the proposed method and two conventional methods under various simulated conditions of sample size and distribution of trait frequency.
G04.2		2008378689	G04.2_2008378689_7	The result of the power analysis confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to the conventional methods.
G04.2		2138850382	G04.2_2138850382_1	Motivation: Targeted data extraction methods are attractive ways to obtain quantitative peptide information from a proteomics experiment.
G04.2		2138850382	G04.2_2138850382_2	Sequential Window Acquisition of all Theoretical Spectra (SWATH) and Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) methods increase reproducibility of acquired data because the classical precursor selection is omitted and all present precursors are fragmented.
G04.2		2138850382	G04.2_2138850382_3	However, especially for targeted data extraction, MS coordinates (retention time information precursor and fragment masses) are required for the particular entities (peptide ions).
G04.2		2138850382	G04.2_2138850382_4	These coordinates are usually generated in a so-called discovery experiment earlier on in the project if not available in public spectral library repositories.
G04.2		2138850382	G04.2_2138850382_5	The quality of the assay panel is crucial to ensure appropriate downstream analysis.
G04.2		2138850382	G04.2_2138850382_6	For that, a method is needed to create spectral libraries and to export customizable assay panels.
G04.2		2138850382	G04.2_2138850382_7	Results: Here, we present a versatile set of functions to generate assay panels from spectral libraries for use in targeted data extraction methods (SWATH/DIA) in the area of proteomics.

G04.3		2108484489	G04.3_2108484489_3	One challenge is the comparison of temporal expression data obtained from different growth conditions where the patterns of expression may be shifted in time.
G04.3		2108484489	G04.3_2108484489_4	We propose the use of wavelet analysis to transform the data obtained under different growth conditions to permit comparison of expression patterns from experiments that have time shifts or delays.

G04.3		2154181498	G04.3_2154181498_3	This leads to the challenge of having to reconcile competing objectives: providing a high-level overview without omitting relevant information, and showing interaction specifics while not overwhelming users with too much detail displayed simultaneously.

G04.3		2134223330	G04.3_2134223330_3	These approaches typically rely on existing transcript annotations, introducing a bias towards known genes, require specific experimental design and computational resources, or focus only on identification of splice variants (ignoring other biologically relevant transcribed features contained within the data that may be important for downstream analysis).
G04.3		2134223330	G04.3_2134223330_4	Biologically relevant transcribed features also include large and small non-coding RNA, new transcription start sites, alternative promoters, RNA editing and processing of coding transcripts.

G04.3		2904976234	G04.3_2904976234_2	However, healthcare provider adherence to hand hygiene remains low.
G04.3		2904976234	G04.3_2904976234_3	Due to the invisible nature of microorganisms and delayed expression of healthcare associated infections, healthcare providers are rarely aware of transmission dynamics and they donu0027t receive feedback about the consequences of missed hand hygiene.
G04.3		2904976234	G04.3_2904976234_4	This situation makes it difficult to associate unsafe behaviors with their negative consequences.
G04.3		2904976234	G04.3_2904976234_5	We introduce the concept of an experiential virtual training environment for hand hygiene, where feedback about microorganism transmission and infectious outcomes are introduced visually, thereby enhancing associative learning and increasing intrinsic motivation to perform hand hygiene.

G04.3		2059387610	G04.3_2059387610_2	The success of antiretroviral treatment of HIV infection heavily depends on the knowledge of an intra-patientu0027s viral population heterogeneity, because diversity and in particular, low frequency variants affect virulence, immune escape, and drug resistance.
G05.2		2951038219	G05.2_2951038219_1	The rapid adoption of CRISPR technology has enabled biomedical researchers to conduct CRISPR-based genetic screens in a pooled format.
G05.2		2951038219	G05.2_2951038219_2	The quality of results from such screens is heavily dependent on the selection of optimal screen design parameters, which also affects cost and scalability.
G05.2		2951038219	G05.2_2951038219_3	However, the cost and effort of implementing pooled screens prohibits experimental testing of a large number of parameters.

G05.2		2134023754	G05.2_2134023754_1	Sequencing of prokaryotic genomes has recently revealed the presence of CRISPR elements: short, highly conserved repeats separated by unique sequences of similar length.
G05.2		2134023754	G05.2_2134023754_2	The distinctive sequence signature of CRISPR repeats can be found using general-purpose repeat- or pattern-finding software tools.
G05.2		2134023754	G05.2_2134023754_3	However, the output of such tools is not always ideal for studying these repeats, and significant effort is sometimes needed to build additional tools and perform manual analysis of the output.
G05.2		2079624216	G05.2_2079624216_1	Abstract   Protection of bacterial cells against virus infection requires expression of molecules that are able to destroy the incoming foreign DNA.
G05.2		2079624216	G05.2_2079624216_2	However, these molecules can also be toxic for the host cell.
G05.2		2079624216	G05.2_2079624216_3	In both restriction–modification (R–M), and the recently discovered CRISPR/Cas systems, the toxicity is (in part) avoided through rapid transition of the expression of the toxic molecules from “OFF” to “ON” state.
G05.2		2079624216	G05.2_2079624216_4	In restriction–modification systems the rapid transition is achieved through a large binding cooperativity, and low translation rate of the control protein.
G05.2		2079624216	G05.2_2079624216_5	On the other hand, CRISPR array expression in CRISPR/Cas systems involves a mechanism where a small decrease of unprocessed RNAs leads to a rapid increase of processed small RNAs.
G05.2		2079624216	G05.2_2079624216_6	Surprisingly, this rapid amplification crucially depends on fast non-specific degradation of the unprocessed molecules by an unidentified nuclease, rather than on large cooperativity in protein binding.
G05.2		2079624216	G05.2_2079624216_7	Furthermore, the major control elements that are responsible for fast transition of R–M and CRISPR/Cas systems from “OFF” to “ON” state, are also directly involved in increased stability of the steady states of these systems.
G05.2		2079624216	G05.2_2079624216_8	We here discuss mechanisms that allow rapid transition of toxic molecules from the unproductive to the productive state in R–M and CRISPR/Cas systems.
G05.2		2079624216	G05.2_2079624216_9	The main purpose of this discussion is to put relevant theoretical and experimental work in a perspective that points to general similarities in otherwise mechanistically very different bacterial immune systems.

G05.2		99676222	G05.2_99676222_3	We design an enhancement to CRISPR-Cas immune systems and demonstrate the learning potential of the modified system by showing it can approximate solutions to a computationally hard problem.
G05.2		99676222	G05.2_99676222_4	To our knowledge this is the first proposed use of CRISPR-Cas systems for computational purposes.
G05.2		2619937803	G05.2_2619937803_1	We estimate the number of spacers in a CRISPR array of a bacterium which maximizes its protection against a viral attack.
G05.2		2619937803	G05.2_2619937803_2	The optimality follows from a competition between two trends: too few distinct spacers make the bacteria vulnerable to an attack by a virus with mutated corresponding protospacers, while an excessive variety of spacers dilutes the number of the CRISPR complexes armed with the most recent and thus most effective spacers.
G05.2		2619937803	G05.2_2619937803_3	We first evaluate the optimal number of spacers in a simple scenario of an infection by a single viral species and later consider a more general case of multiple viral species.
G05.2		2619937803	G05.2_2619937803_4	We find that depending on such parameters as the concentration of CRISPR-CAS interference complexes and its preference to arm with more recently acquired spacers, the rate of viral mutation, and the number of viral species, the predicted optimal array length lies within a range quite reasonable from the viewpoint of recent experiments.
G05.2		2563361853	G05.2_2563361853_1	Using a metagenomic approach, three types of CRISPR–Cas systems have been discovered in uncultivated bacterial and archaeal hosts from a variety of different environments.
G05.2		2157413902	G05.2_2157413902_1	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) elements are a particular family of tandem repeats present in prokaryotic genomes, in almost all archaea and in about half of bacteria, and which participate in a mechanism of acquired resistance against phages.
G05.2		2157413902	G05.2_2157413902_2	They consist in a succession of direct repeats (DR) of 24–47 bp separated by similar sized unique sequences (spacers).
G05.2		2157413902	G05.2_2157413902_3	In the large majority of cases, the direct repeats are highly conserved, while the number and nature of the spacers are often quite diverse, even among strains of a same species.
G05.2		2157413902	G05.2_2157413902_4	Furthermore, the acquisition of new units (DR + spacer) was shown to happen almost exclusively on one side of the locus.
G05.2		2157413902	G05.2_2157413902_5	Therefore, the CRISPR presents an interesting genetic marker for comparative and evolutionary analysis of closely related bacterial strains.
G05.2		2157413902	G05.2_2157413902_6	CRISPRcompar is a web service created to assist biologists in the CRISPR typing process.
G05.2		2157413902	G05.2_2157413902_7	Two tools facilitates the in silico investigation: CRISPRcomparison and CRISPRtionary.

G05.2		2951526897	G05.2_2951526897_1	Background: As a result of its simplicity and high efficiency, the CRISPR-Cas system has been widely used as a genome editing tool.
G05.2		2951526897	G05.2_2951526897_2	Recently, CRISPR base editors, which consist of deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) or Cas9 nickase (nCas9) linked with a cytidine or a guanine deaminase, have been developed.
G05.2		2951526897	G05.2_2951526897_3	Base editing tools will be very useful for gene correction because they can produce highly specific DNA substitutions without the introduction of any donor DNA, but dedicated web-based tools to facilitate the use of such tools have not yet been developed.
G05.2		2951526897	G05.2_2951526897_4	Results: We present two web tools for base editors, named BE-Designer and BE-Analyzer.
G05.2		2951526897	G05.2_2951526897_5	BE-Designer provides all possible base editor target sequences in a given input DNA sequence with useful information including potential off-target sites.
G05.2		2951526897	G05.2_2951526897_6	BE-Analyzer, a tool for assessing base editing outcomes from next generation sequencing (NGS) data, provides information about mutations in a table and interactive graphs.
G05.2		2951526897	G05.2_2951526897_7	Furthermore, because the tool runs client-side, large amounts of targeted deep sequencing data (u003e100MB) do not need to be uploaded to a server, substantially reducing running time and increasing data security.
G05.2		2951526897	G05.2_2951526897_8	BE-Designer and BE-Analyzer can be freely accessed at http://www.rgenome.net/bedesigner/ and http://www.rgenome.net/be-analyzer/ respectively Conclusion: We develop two useful web tools to design target sequence (BE-Designer) and to analyze NGS data from experimental results (BE-Analyzer) for CRISPR base editors.

G05.2		2920824461	G05.2_2920824461_1	Hidetaka Yakura provides an interesting contribution to the discussion on minimal cognition.
G05.2		2920824461	G05.2_2920824461_2	He develops the idea that the CRISPR/Cas immune system, as present in many bacteria and archaea, can itself be cast as a minimal cognitive system.
G05.2		2883250809	G05.2_2883250809_1	As a result of its simplicity and high efficiency, the CRISPR-Cas system has been widely used as a genome editing tool.

G05.2		2883250809	G05.2_2883250809_8	"BE-Designer and BE-Analyzer can be freely accessed at                                                            and                                                           :[263],""/, respectively."
G05.2		2883250809	G05.2_2883250809_9	We develop two useful web tools to design target sequence (BE-Designer) and to analyze NGS data from experimental results (BE-Analyzer) for CRISPR base editors.
G05.2		2952643052	G05.2_2952643052_1	CRISPR-Cas9 technology can be used to engineer precise genomic deletions with pairs of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs).
G05.2		2952643052	G05.2_2952643052_2	This approach has been widely adopted for diverse applications, from disease modelling of individual loci, to parallelized loss-of-function screens of thousands of regulatory elements.
G05.2		2952643052	G05.2_2952643052_3	However, no solution has been presented for the unique bioinformatic design requirements of CRISPR deletion.
G05.2		2952643052	G05.2_2952643052_4	We here present CRISPETa, a pipeline for flexible and scalable paired sgRNA design based on an empirical scoring model.
G05.2		2952643052	G05.2_2952643052_5	Multiple sgRNA pairs are returned for each target, and any number of targets can be analyzed in parallel, making CRISPETa equally useful for focussed or high-throughput studies.
G05.2		2952643052	G05.2_2952643052_6	Fast run-times are achieved using a pre-computed off-target database.
G05.2		2952643052	G05.2_2952643052_7	sgRNA pair designs are output in a convenient format for visualisation and oligonucleotide ordering.
G05.2		2952643052	G05.2_2952643052_8	We present pre-designed, high-coverage library designs for entire classes of protein-coding and non-coding elements in human, mouse, zebrafish, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans.
G05.2		2952643052	G05.2_2952643052_9	In human cells, we reproducibly observe deletion efficiencies of ≥50% for CRISPETa designs targeting an enhancer and exonic fragment of the MALAT1 oncogene.
G05.2		2952643052	G05.2_2952643052_10	In the latter case, deletion results in production of desired, truncated RNA.
G05.2		2952643052	G05.2_2952643052_11	CRISPETa will be useful for researchers seeking to harness CRISPR for targeted genomic deletion, in a variety of model organisms, from single-target to high-throughput scales.
G05.2		2765610460	G05.2_2765610460_1	The adaptation of the CRISPR-Cas9 system as a genome editing technique has generated much excitement in recent years owing to its ability to manipulate targeted genes and genomic regions that are complementary to a programmed single guide RNA (sgRNA).
G05.2		2765610460	G05.2_2765610460_2	However, the efficacy of a specific sgRNA is not uniquely defined by exact sequence homology to the target site, thus unintended off-targets might additionally be cleaved.
G05.2		2765610460	G05.2_2765610460_3	Current methods for sgRNA design are mainly concerned with predicting off-targets for a given sgRNA using basic sequence features and employ elementary rules for ranking possible sgRNAs.
G05.2		2765610460	G05.2_2765610460_4	Here, we introduce CRISTA (CRISPR Target Assessment), a novel algorithm within the machine learning framework that determines the propensity of a genomic site to be cleaved by a given sgRNA.
G05.2		2765610460	G05.2_2765610460_5	We show that the predictions made with CRISTA are more accurate than other available methodologies.
G05.2		2765610460	G05.2_2765610460_6	We further demonstrate that the occurrence of bulges is not a rare phenomenon and should be accounted for in the prediction process.
G05.2		2765610460	G05.2_2765610460_7	Beyond predicting cleavage efficiencies, the learning process provides inferences regarding patterns that underlie the mechanism of action of the CRISPR-Cas9 system.
G05.2		2765610460	G05.2_2765610460_8	We discover that attributes that describe the spatial structure and rigidity of the entire genomic site as well as those surrounding the PAM region are a major component of the prediction capabilities.
G05.2		2762992477	G05.2_2762992477_1	The CRISPR/Cas-based genome editing system has provided a powerful tool for control of gene activity within cells.
G05.2		2762992477	G05.2_2762992477_2	Here, we model an experimentally plausible architecture harnessing the power of CRISPR/Cas to create a biomolecular bistable switch.
G05.2		2762992477	G05.2_2762992477_3	The designed in vitro circuit is based on mutual repression of two genes together with two other activator genes.
G05.2		2762992477	G05.2_2762992477_4	The repression is generated by the binding of catalytically dead endonuclease (dCas9) to the target gene mediated by a guide RNA.
G05.2		2762992477	G05.2_2762992477_5	The activation is accomplished by use of an antiguide RNA partially complementary to the guide RNA.
G05.2		2762992477	G05.2_2762992477_6	Using mathematical analysis of the model, we show that the proposed scheme is capable of exhibiting bistability.
G05.2		2762992477	G05.2_2762992477_7	We further discuss ultrasensitivity of the regulatory modules, and their capacity to manage competition for dCas9 and downstream load.
G05.2		2592080096	G05.2_2592080096_1	CRISPR-Cas systems have been successfully applied in genome editing.
G05.2		2592080096	G05.2_2592080096_2	Recently, the CRISPR-C2c2 system has been reported as a tool for RNA editing.
G05.2		2592080096	G05.2_2592080096_3	Here we describe CRISPR-RT (CRISPR RNA-Targeting), the first web service to help biologists design the crRNA with improved target specificity for the CRISPR-C2c2 system.
G05.2		2592080096	G05.2_2592080096_4	CRISPR-RT allows users to set up a wide range of parameters, making it highly flexible for current and future research in CRISPR-based RNA editing.
G05.2		2592080096	G05.2_2592080096_5	CRISPR-RT covers major model organisms and can be easily extended to cover other species.
G05.2		2592080096	G05.2_2592080096_6	CRISPR-RT will empower researchers in RNA editing.
G05.2		2592080096	G05.2_2592080096_7	It is available at http://bioinfolab.miamioh.edu/CRISPR-RT.
G05.2		2115083845	G05.2_2115083845_1	CRISPRs offer adaptive immunity in prokaryotes by acquiring genomic fragments from infecting phage and subsequently exploiting them for phage restriction via an RNAi-like mechanism.
G05.2		2115083845	G05.2_2115083845_2	Here, we develop and analyze a dynamical model of CRISPR-mediated prokaryote-phage coevolution that incorporates classical CRISPR kinetics along with the recently discovered infection-induced activation and autoimmunity side effects.
G05.2		2115083845	G05.2_2115083845_3	Our analyses reveal two striking characteristics of the CRISPR defense strategy: that both restriction and abortive infections operate during coevolution with phages, driving phages to much lower densities than possible with restriction alone, and that CRISPR maintenance is determined by a key dimensionless combination of parameters, which upper bounds the activation level of CRISPRs in uninfected populations.
G05.2		2115083845	G05.2_2115083845_4	We contrast these qualitative observations with experimental data on CRISPR kinetics, which offer insight into the spacer deletion mechanism and the observed low CRISPR prevalence in clinical isolates.
G05.2		2115083845	G05.2_2115083845_5	More generally, we exploit numerical simulations to delineate four regimes of CRISPR dynamics in terms of its host, kinetic, and regulatory parameters.
G06.2		2586990006	G06.2_2586990006_1	Until the day comes when all vehicles are fully autonomous, self-driving cars must be more than safe and efficient--they must also understand and interact naturally with human drivers.
G06.2		2586990006	G06.2_2586990006_2	"The web extras include videos demonstrating ""rude"" behavior by Teslau0027s Autopilot system, www.youtube.com/watch?v=el4OdwtgzNk; a human driver confused by self-driving technology, www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uj-rK8V-rik; and aggressive driving prompted by self-driving technology, www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSQm3YaAzA."
G06.2		1593194988	G06.2_1593194988_1	The emergence of self-driving vehicles holds great promise for the future of transportation.
G06.2		1593194988	G06.2_1593194988_2	While it will still be a number of years before fully self-driving vehicles can safely and legally drive unoccupied on U.S. streets, once this is possible, a new transportation mode for personal travel looks set to arrive.
G06.2		1593194988	G06.2_1593194988_3	This new mode is the shared autonomous vehicle (SAV), combining features of short-term on-demand rentals with self-driving capabilities.
G06.2		2294896158	G06.2_2294896158_1	In this paper we propose a security system to protect external communications for self-driving and semi self-driving cars.
G06.2		2294896158	G06.2_2294896158_2	The proposed system can detect malicious vehicles in an urban mobility scenario.
G06.2		2294896158	G06.2_2294896158_3	The anomaly detection system is based on fuzzy petri nets (FPN) to detect packet dropping attacks in vehicular ad hoc networks.
G06.2		2294896158	G06.2_2294896158_4	The experimental results show the proposed FPN-IDS can successfully detect DoS attacks in external communication of self-driving vehicles.
G06.2		2947742306	G06.2_2947742306_1	Effective simulation and testing environment is a vital part in the research of self-driving vehicles.
G06.2		2947742306	G06.2_2947742306_2	It is capable of testing self-driving software and hardware quickly in a variety of virtual environments at low cost.
G06.2		2947742306	G06.2_2947742306_3	However, as for the current mainstream simulation platforms, a considerable gap exists between the constructed virtual environment and the actual self-driving platform, which decreases the efficiency of development and makes it difficult to complete the migration from the virtual scenario to the real environment.
G06.2		2947742306	G06.2_2947742306_4	Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a novel hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) simulation system.
G06.2		2947742306	G06.2_2947742306_5	It takes the real hardware electronic control unit (ECU) of the self-driving vehicle as a part of the simulation platform, which improves the efficiency of development and testing, and also, the verified algorithms can be implemented into self-driving cars faster than ever before.
G06.2		2947742306	G06.2_2947742306_6	The proposed HiL simulation system mainly consists of four parts: the vehicle kinematic model simulation, the multi-sensor simulation, the environment simulation, and the ECU hardware.
G06.2		2947742306	G06.2_2947742306_7	Simulation experiments on applying the HiL system are used to verify the validity of self-driving algorithms in virtual scenes, including perception, planning, decision making, and control.
G06.2		2947742306	G06.2_2947742306_8	Furthermore, algorithms that are tested in the simulation environment can be rapidly deployed into the real self-driving vehicles.
G06.2		2947742306	G06.2_2947742306_9	In this paper, we also presented the verification processes of various algorithms, such as planning and control.
G06.2		2947742306	G06.2_2947742306_10	These algorithms are implemented in the HiL system, and the experimental results show the validity of our proposed platform.
G06.2		2206539748	G06.2_2206539748_1	Self-driving technologies have matured and improved to the point that, in the past few years, self-driving cars have been able to safely drive an impressive number of kilometers.
G06.2		2206539748	G06.2_2206539748_2	It should be noted though that, in all cases, the driver seat was never empty: a human driver was behind the wheel, ready to take over whenever the situation dictated it.
G06.2		2206539748	G06.2_2206539748_3	This is an interesting paradox since the point of a self-driving car is to remove the most unreliable part of the car, namely the human driver.
G06.2		2206539748	G06.2_2206539748_4	So, the question naturally arises: will the driver seat ever be empty?
G06.2		2206539748	G06.2_2206539748_5	Besides legal liability issues, the answer to that question may lie in our ability to improve the self-driving technologies to the point that the human driver can safely be removed from the driving loop altogether.
G06.2		2206539748	G06.2_2206539748_6	However, things are not that simple.
G06.2		2206539748	G06.2_2206539748_7	Motion safety, i.e.
G06.2		2206539748	G06.2_2206539748_8	the ability to avoid collisions, is the critical aspect concerning self-driving cars and autonomous vehicles in general.
G06.2		2206539748	G06.2_2206539748_9	Before letting self-driving cars transport people around (and move among them) in a truly autonomous way, it is crucial to assess their ability to avoid collision, and to seek to characterize the levels of motion safety that can be achieved and the conditions under which they can be guaranteed.
G06.2		2206539748	G06.2_2206539748_10	All these issues are explored in this article.
G06.2		2770887428	G06.2_2770887428_1	This paper proposes a visual navigation strategy for self-driving car running on a constant-width road.
G06.2		2770887428	G06.2_2770887428_2	The task is to process road image with multiple elements information for planing path and providing the basis for acceleration and deceleration.
G06.2		2770887428	G06.2_2770887428_3	Common road elements are straight, bend, ramp and crossroad.
G06.2		2770887428	G06.2_2770887428_4	We propose a novel navigation framework (BCVN) that explicitly decomposes the visual navigation task into navigation line extraction, deviation calculation and curvature calculation.
G06.2		2770887428	G06.2_2770887428_5	The core idea of navigation line extraction is Building-Climbing.
G06.2		2770887428	G06.2_2770887428_6	Building is to build foundations with a small number of consecutive points.
G06.2		2770887428	G06.2_2770887428_7	Climbing is to climb points on the basis of the foundations.
G06.2		2770887428	G06.2_2770887428_8	Building and Climbing are both used in search of bilateral edges.
G06.2		2770887428	G06.2_2770887428_9	Deviation calculation use the method of dynamic weighting for self-driving car to control steering.
G06.2		2770887428	G06.2_2770887428_10	Curvature calculation is to obtain a suitable value for self-driving car to achieve acceleration and deceleration control.
G06.2		2770887428	G06.2_2770887428_11	We use least squares algorithm to assist in bilateral edges search and curvature calculation.
G06.2		2770887428	G06.2_2770887428_12	We describe our real-time implementation of the BCVN framework, the method of dynamic weight and Building-Climbing.
G06.2		2770887428	G06.2_2770887428_13	We test the strategy on the self-driving car platform, which shows strong adaptability and high efficiency.
G07.1		2296328209	G07.1_2296328209_1	In recent years, more and more people join social networks to share information with others.
G07.1		2296328209	G07.1_2296328209_2	At the same time, the information sharing/spreading becomes far more frequent and convenient due to the wide usage of mobile devices.
G07.1		2296328209	G07.1_2296328209_3	As a result, the messages created are very arbitrary, which may contain a lot of misinformation.
G07.1		2296328209	G07.1_2296328209_4	Proper actions must be taken to avoid the spreading of misinformation or rumors before it causes serious damages.
G07.1		2296328209	G07.1_2296328209_5	Therefore, any misinformation should be discovered in time when it does not spread to a large group of people.
G07.1		2296328209	G07.1_2296328209_6	All previous works studied either how the information is spread in the social network or how to inhibit the further pervasion of an observed misinformation.
G07.1		2296328209	G07.1_2296328209_7	However, no works considered how to discover the broadcasting of misinformation in time.
G07.1		2296328209	G07.1_2296328209_8	A possible solution is to set observers across the network to discover the suspects of misinformation.
G07.1		2296328209	G07.1_2296328209_9	In this paper, we design a novel mechanism to select a set of observers in a social network with the minimum cost, where these observers guarantee any misinformation can be discovered with a high probability before it reaches a bounded number of users.
G07.1		2296328209	G07.1_2296328209_10	Extensive experiment on real data sets verifies the effectiveness of our solution.
G07.1		2794299292	G07.1_2794299292_1	In the wake of the panic over fake news that followed the 2016 US presidential election, librarians and other information professionals are being urged to “take leadership in the current crisis” (Jacobson, 2017: 24).
G07.1		2794299292	G07.1_2794299292_2	The response from the profession has been to reaffirm the core values of librarianship and to hold up traditional services as a means for combating misinformation.
G07.1		2794299292	G07.1_2794299292_3	The problem is that these solutions are offered in the absence of a full understanding of the real danger of misinformation, which is “not just [that] misinformation is ‘out there,’” but “what misinformation does to our mind” (Ecker, 2015: 22).
G07.1		2794299292	G07.1_2794299292_4	Misinformation research in other fields directly challenges the solutions proposed by library professionals and casts doubts on their underlying assumptions.
G07.1		2794299292	G07.1_2794299292_5	This article provides an overview of the library and information science approach to misinformation in the United States, discusses the shortcomings of that approach, and points to possible next steps for remedying the problem.
G07.1		2266011355	G07.1_2266011355_1	Mobile Opportunistic Networks (MONs) are effective solutions to uphold communications in the situations where traditional communication networks are unavailable.
G07.1		2266011355	G07.1_2266011355_2	In MONs, messages can be disseminated among mobile nodes in an epidemic and delay-tolerant manner.
G07.1		2266011355	G07.1_2266011355_3	However, MONs can be abused to disseminate misinformation causing undesirable effects in the general public, such as panic and misunderstanding.
G07.1		2266011355	G07.1_2266011355_4	To deal with this issue, we first propose a formal model to formulate the process of misinformation propagation in MONs, considering human psychological behaviors.
G07.1		2266011355	G07.1_2266011355_5	Secondly, we explore a general framework to describe the random node mobility, and derive a new contact rate between nodes, which is closely related to mobility properties of nodes.
G07.1		2266011355	G07.1_2266011355_6	Thirdly, we propose a novel approach based on vaccination and treatment strategies for inhibiting misinformation propagation in human MONs.
G07.1		2266011355	G07.1_2266011355_7	Moreover, a novel pulse control model of misinformation propagation is developed.
G07.1		2266011355	G07.1_2266011355_8	Finally, through the derivation and stability analysis of a misinformation-free period solution of the proposed model, we obtain a threshold upon which misinformation dies out in a human MON.
G07.1		2266011355	G07.1_2266011355_9	The extensive simulation results validate our theoretical analysis.
G07.1		2741930413	G07.1_2741930413_1	The fast expanding of social media fuels the spreading of misinformation which disrupts peopleu0027s normal lives.
G07.1		2741930413	G07.1_2741930413_2	It is urgent to achieve goals of misinformation identification and early detection in social media.
G07.1		2741930413	G07.1_2741930413_3	In dynamic and complicated social media scenarios, some conventional methods mainly concentrate on feature engineering which fail to cover potential features in new scenarios and have difficulty in shaping elaborate high-level interactions among significant features.
G07.1		2741930413	G07.1_2741930413_4	Moreover, a recent Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based method suffers from deficiencies that it is not qualified for practical early detection of misinformation and poses a bias to the latest input.
G07.1		2741930413	G07.1_2741930413_5	In this paper, we propose a novel method, Convolutional Approach for Misinformation Identification (CAMI) based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
G07.1		2741930413	G07.1_2741930413_6	CAMI can flexibly extract key features scattered among an input sequence and shape high-level interactions among significant features, which help effectively identify misinformation and achieve practical early detection.
G07.1		2741930413	G07.1_2741930413_7	Experiment results on two large-scale datasets validate the effectiveness of CAMI model on both misinformation identification and early detection tasks.
G07.1		3007380484	G07.1_3007380484_1	During humanitarian crises, there is a need for a large amount of information in a short period of time.
G07.1		3007380484	G07.1_3007380484_2	Such need creates the base for misinformation such as rumors, fake news or hoaxes to spread within and outside the affected community.
G07.1		3007380484	G07.1_3007380484_3	This results in (mis)information harms that can generate serious short term or long-term consequences.
G07.1		3007380484	G07.1_3007380484_4	In such situations, there is a need for a joint human-machine effort to mitigate such harms.
G07.1		3007380484	G07.1_3007380484_5	Computational scientists have created misinformation detection systems and algorithms, while social scientists have examined the roles of involved parties, examined the way misinformation spreads and convinces people.
G07.1		3007380484	G07.1_3007380484_6	However, there has been no work, to our knowledge, in examining situations when the machine and human interact with each other in the context of misinformation.
G07.1		3007380484	G07.1_3007380484_7	In order to systematically examine the harms from misinformation, we draw on Activity Theory to suggest a suitable framework.
G07.1		3007380484	G07.1_3007380484_8	Such a framework enables interactions among the human and machines and their respective loops for the purpose of mitigation of misinformation harms
G07.1		2740045046	G07.1_2740045046_1	Abstract   Online Social Networks (OSNs) constitute one of the most important communication channels and are widely utilized as news sources.
G07.1		2740045046	G07.1_2740045046_2	Information spreads widely and rapidly in OSNs through the word-of-mouth effect.
G07.1		2740045046	G07.1_2740045046_3	However, it is not uncommon for misinformation to propagate in the network.
G07.1		2740045046	G07.1_2740045046_4	Misinformation dissemination may lead to undesirable effects, especially in cases where the non-credible information concerns emergency events.
G07.1		2740045046	G07.1_2740045046_5	Therefore, it is essential to timely limit the propagation of misinformation.
G07.1		2740045046	G07.1_2740045046_6	Towards this goal, we suggest a novel propagation model, namely the Dynamic Linear Threshold (DLT) model, that effectively captures the way contradictory information, i.e., misinformation and credible information, propagates in the network.
G07.1		2740045046	G07.1_2740045046_7	The DLT model considers the probability of a user alternating between competing beliefs, assisting in either the propagation of misinformation or credible news.
G07.1		2740045046	G07.1_2740045046_8	Based on the DLT model, we formulate an optimization problem that under cost constraints aims in identifying the most appropriate subset of users to limit the spread of misinformation by initiating the propagation of credible information.
G07.1		2740045046	G07.1_2740045046_9	We prove that our suggested approach achieves an approximation ratio of     1  −  1  /  e     and demonstrate by experimental evaluation that it outperforms its competitors.
G07.1		1588558377	G07.1_1588558377_1	Online Social Networks (OSNs), such as Facebook, Twitter and Google+, facilitate the interactions and communications among people.
G07.1		1588558377	G07.1_1588558377_2	However, they also make it a fertile land for misinformation to rapidly spread out, which may lead to detrimental consequences.
G07.1		1588558377	G07.1_1588558377_3	Thus it is imperative to detect the misinformation propagating through OSNs by placing monitors.
G07.1		1588558377	G07.1_1588558377_4	In this paper, we first study a general misinformation detection problem and show its equivalence to the influence maximization problem.
G07.1		1588558377	G07.1_1588558377_5	Moreover, in order to prevent misinformation from reaching specific users, we define a τ-Monitor Placement problem for cases where the partial knowledge of misinformation sources is available.
G07.1		1588558377	G07.1_1588558377_6	We prove the #P complexity of this problem and additionally propose an efficient algorithm to solve it.
G07.1		1588558377	G07.1_1588558377_7	Extensive experiments on real-world data show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm with respect to minimizing the number of monitors.
G07.1		2914116198	G07.1_2914116198_1	Abstract   The fast development of social media fuels massive spreading of misinformation, which harm information security at an increasingly severe degree.
G07.1		2914116198	G07.1_2914116198_2	It is urgent to achieve misinformation identification and early detection in social media.
G07.1		2914116198	G07.1_2914116198_3	However, two main difficulties hinder the identification of misinformation.
G07.1		2914116198	G07.1_2914116198_4	First, an event about a piece of suspicious news usually comprises massive microblog posts (hereinafter referred to as post), and it is hard to directly model the event with massive-volume posts.
G07.1		2914116198	G07.1_2914116198_5	Second, information in social media is of high noise, i.e., most posts about an event have little contribution to misinformation identification.
G07.1		2914116198	G07.1_2914116198_6	To resolve the difficulty of massive volume, we propose an Event2vec module to learn distributed representations of events in social media.
G07.1		2914116198	G07.1_2914116198_7	To overcome the difficulty of high noise, we mine significant posts via content and temporal co-attention, which learn importance weights for content and temporal information of events.
G07.1		2914116198	G07.1_2914116198_8	In this paper, we propose an Attention-based Convolutional Approach for Misinformation Identification (ACAMI) model.
G07.1		2914116198	G07.1_2914116198_9	The Event2vec module and the co-attention contribute to learning a good representation of an event.
G07.1		2914116198	G07.1_2914116198_10	Then the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can flexibly extract key features scattered among an input sequence and shape high-level interactions among significant features, which help effectively identify misinformation and achieve practical early detection.
G07.1		2914116198	G07.1_2914116198_11	Experimental results on two typical datasets validate the effectiveness of the ACAMI model on misinformation identification and early detection tasks.
G07.1		568829167	G07.1_568829167_1	It has been reported that about 113 million Americans has looked for health information on the internet.
G07.1		568829167	G07.1_568829167_2	Patient safety can therefore be very easily compromised if the advice/information that people receive is incorrect.
G07.1		568829167	G07.1_568829167_3	Particularly in case of a chronic and debilitating disease like Parkinson’s disease, patients are very vulnerable to false information.
G07.1		568829167	G07.1_568829167_4	Spread of misinformation can be a serious deterrent to information system use.
G07.1		568829167	G07.1_568829167_5	However, the literature has been weak in linking the prevalence of misinformation on online social networks to the factors contributing to misinformation.
G07.1		568829167	G07.1_568829167_6	This study seeks to reduce this gap by exploring the factors impacting the extent of misinformation in online social networking forum.
G07.1		568829167	G07.1_568829167_7	Our findings show that the quality of a response is affected by clarity of the thread question, cumulative information quality and the users’ potential for making useful contributions.
G07.1		568829167	G07.1_568829167_8	The results from this study provide practical suggestions to reduce misinformation on social networks.
G07.1		2552421666	G07.1_2552421666_1	While online social networks provide access to a massive information source, they also enable wide dissemination of false or inaccurate content.
G07.1		2552421666	G07.1_2552421666_2	Undesirable results caused by misinformation propagation make its timely detection very imperative.
G07.1		2552421666	G07.1_2552421666_3	An important question is how many monitors are required to detect all misinformation cascades at their early stage.
G07.1		2552421666	G07.1_2552421666_4	To answer this question, we define a Time Constrained Misinformation Detection (TCMD) problem.
G07.1		2552421666	G07.1_2552421666_5	As we have proved, there is no polynomial time (1 - e) ln n-approximation for the TCMD problem.
G07.1		2552421666	G07.1_2552421666_6	The large number of independent misinformation cascades and heterogeneous delays make misinformation detection more challenging.
G07.1		2552421666	G07.1_2552421666_7	Our approach includes stochastic programming and an O(ln(1 + n)) approximation algorithm for one-hop detection.
G07.1		2552421666	G07.1_2552421666_8	This approach can provide a lower bound on the number of required monitors for general detection.
G07.1		2552421666	G07.1_2552421666_9	Furthermore, we propose a network-compression based solution, whose effectiveness is validated by extensive experimental results.
G07.1		2613068310	G07.1_2613068310_1	The emergence of online social networks has revolutionized the way people seek and share information.
G07.1		2613068310	G07.1_2613068310_2	Nowadays, popular online social sites as Twitter, Facebook and Google+ are among the major news sources as well as the most effective channels for viral marketing.
G07.1		2613068310	G07.1_2613068310_3	However, these networks also became the most effective channel for spreading misinformation, accidentally or maliciously.
G07.1		2613068310	G07.1_2613068310_4	The widespread diffusion of inaccurate information or fake news can lead to undesirable and severe consequences, such as widespread panic, libelous campaigns and conspiracies.
G07.1		2613068310	G07.1_2613068310_5	"In order to guarantee the trustworthiness of online social networks it is a crucial challenge to find effective strategies to contrast the spread of the misinformation in the  :[108],""this paper we concentrate our attention on two problems related to the diffusion of misinformation in social networks: identify the misinformation sources and limit its diffusion in the network."
G07.1		2613068310	G07.1_2613068310_6	We consider a social network where some nodes have already been infected from misinformation.
G07.1		2613068310	G07.1_2613068310_7	We first provide an heuristics to recognize the set of most probable sources of the infection.
G07.1		2613068310	G07.1_2613068310_8	Then, we provide an heuristics to place a few monitors in some network nodes in order to control information diffused by the suspected nodes and block misinformation they injected in the network before it reaches a large part of the network.
G07.1		2613068310	G07.1_2613068310_9	To verify the quality and efficiency of our suggested solutions, we conduct experiments on several real-world networks.
G07.1		2613068310	G07.1_2613068310_10	Empirical results indicate that our heuristics are among the most effective known in literature.
G07.1		2471998607	G07.1_2471998607_1	As more individuals turn to social network sites (SNSs) for information, the spread of misinformation in these sites is becoming a greater concern.
G07.1		2471998607	G07.1_2471998607_2	Not only can misinformation cause individual users anxiety and harm, but it can also prevent SNSs from realizing their full potential as trustworthy sources of information.
G07.1		2471998607	G07.1_2471998607_3	This study proposed and tested an intervention-based strategy that was designed to discourage behavior that promotes the spread of misinformation.
G07.1		2471998607	G07.1_2471998607_4	Guided by the social cognitive theory (SCT), the intervention sought to modify usersu0027 outcome expectations by presenting them with a message that highlighted the negative consequences of misinformation.
G07.1		2471998607	G07.1_2471998607_5	To investigate the effectiveness of this intervention message, a classical experiment was conducted on-line with 131 college-student participants.
G07.1		2471998607	G07.1_2471998607_6	"In the studyu0027s experimental group, the ANOVA results showed that the intervention effectively reduced the total number of ""Likes"" and ""Shares"" for postings that provided misinformation."
G07.1		2471998607	G07.1_2471998607_7	Future development and testing of this SCT-guided, outcome-expectations-based intervention is promising.
G07.1		2324763723	G07.1_2324763723_1	Online social networks have become an effective and important social platform for communication, opinions exchange, and information sharing.
G07.1		2324763723	G07.1_2324763723_2	However, they also make it possible for rapid and wide misinformation diffusion, which may lead to pernicious influences on individuals or society.
G07.1		2324763723	G07.1_2324763723_3	Hence, it is extremely important and necessary to detect the misinformation propagation by placing monitors.
G07.1		2324763723	G07.1_2324763723_4	In this article, we first define a general misinformation-detection problem for the case where the knowledge about misinformation sources is lacking, and show its equivalence to the influence-maximization problem in the reverse graph.
G07.1		2324763723	G07.1_2324763723_5	Furthermore, considering node vulnerability, we aim to detect the misinformation reaching to a specific user.
G07.1		2324763723	G07.1_2324763723_6	Therefore, we study a τ-Monitor Placement problem for cases where partial knowledge of misinformation sources is available and prove its #P complexity.
G07.1		2324763723	G07.1_2324763723_7	We formulate a corresponding integer program, tackle exponential constraints, and propose a Minimum Monitor Set Construction (MMSC) algorithm, in which the cut-set2 has been exploited in the estimation of reachability of node pairs.
G07.1		2324763723	G07.1_2324763723_8	Moreover, we generalize the problem from a single target to multiple central nodes and propose another algorithm based on a Monte Carlo sampling technique.
G07.1		2324763723	G07.1_2324763723_9	Extensive experiments on real-world networks show the effectiveness of proposed algorithms with respect to minimizing the number of monitors.
G07.1		2991817245	G07.1_2991817245_1	With the emergence of Online Social Networks (OSNs) as a major platform of communication, its abuse to spread misinformation has become a major threat to our society.
G07.1		2991817245	G07.1_2991817245_2	In this paper, we study the misinformation containment problem in OSN.
G07.1		2991817245	G07.1_2991817245_3	Given a snapshot of the OSN with a set of misinformed nodes, and a budget in terms of maximum number of seed nodes, the problem is to select the seed nodes, referred here as the beacon nodes, to plant the correct information, to minimize and eventually eradicate the misinformation at the earliest.
G07.1		2991817245	G07.1_2991817245_4	We leverage the community structure of the OSN to select the beacon nodes, prioritizing the Community Boundary Nodes.
G07.1		2991817245	G07.1_2991817245_5	To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to exploit the topology of the OSN to combat misinformation spread.
G07.1		2991817245	G07.1_2991817245_6	A modified form of Independent Cascade Model is followed to study the adversarial propagation of both misinformation and the correct information.
G07.1		2991817245	G07.1_2991817245_7	Simulation on real data set shows that the proposed algorithm outperforms earlier algorithm [1] significantly in terms of maximum (average) infected time and the point of decline.
G07.1		2992149285	G07.1_2992149285_1	Misinformation prevention has received much attention due to its important role to user community.
G07.1		2992149285	G07.1_2992149285_2	However, recent studies ignore the influence of the topics of misinformation in the process of information dissemination.
G07.1		2992149285	G07.1_2992149285_3	In fact, the spread of propagation of misinformation depends on their topics.
G07.1		2992149285	G07.1_2992149285_4	Therefore, in order to improve the effectiveness of preventing false information, we need to consider the effect of topics in information dissemination.In this paper, we study the problem of misinformation blocking which considers topics of misinformation sources by removing a set of nodes, called MTMB problem.
G07.1		2992149285	G07.1_2992149285_5	We show that MTMB is NP-hard and the objective function is a monotone and submodular function.
G07.1		2992149285	G07.1_2992149285_6	Based on that, we propose a Greedy Algorithm (GA), which provides a approximation ratio of $\left( {1 - 1/\sqrt e } \right)$.
G07.1		2992149285	G07.1_2992149285_7	We further propose a Scalable Greedy Algorithm (SGA), an efficient algorithm based on speeding up the GA by effective estimating the objective function.
G07.1		2992149285	G07.1_2992149285_8	Experiments are conducted on networks showing the effectiveness and running time of the proposed algorithms which outperform other methods.
G07.1		1999286316	G07.1_1999286316_1	With the advent of Web 2.0, social networks have become an important medium for dissemination of information in the Internet.
G07.1		1999286316	G07.1_1999286316_2	The process of information dissemination in social networks has been studied using a number of information diffusion models.
G07.1		1999286316	G07.1_1999286316_3	Due to the collaborative nature of the networks and limited accountability of the users, the media is often misused for spread of rumours and misinformation.
G07.1		1999286316	G07.1_1999286316_4	In this paper, we have a proposed a novel information diffusion model for the spread of misinformation using Evolutionary game theory and Evolutionary graph theory.
G07.1		1999286316	G07.1_1999286316_5	The proposed model could be used to analyse as well as predict the spread of misinformation.
G07.1		1999286316	G07.1_1999286316_6	It also provides a framework to study the effects of multiple campaigns in the network which would enable us to estimate the efficacy of launching counter campaigns against the spread of misinformation.
G07.1		1999286316	G07.1_1999286316_7	We have used extensive simulation to support our claim.
G07.1		2962981892	G07.1_2962981892_1	With the rapid growth of social media, massive misinformation is also spreading widely on social media, e.g., Weibo and Twitter, and brings negative effects to human life.
G07.1		2962981892	G07.1_2962981892_2	Today, automatic misinformation identification has drawn attention from academic and industrial communities.
G07.1		2962981892	G07.1_2962981892_3	Whereas an event on social media usually consists of multiple microblogs, current methods are mainly constructed based on global statistical features.
G07.1		2962981892	G07.1_2962981892_4	However, information on social media is full of noise, which should be alleviated.
G07.1		2962981892	G07.1_2962981892_5	Moreover, most of the microblogs about an event have little contribution to the identification of misinformation, where useful information can be easily overwhelmed by useless information.
G07.1		2962981892	G07.1_2962981892_6	Thus, it is important to mine significant microblogs for constructing a reliable misinformation identification method.
G07.1		2962981892	G07.1_2962981892_7	In this article, we propose an attention-based approach for identification of misinformation (AIM).
G07.1		2962981892	G07.1_2962981892_8	Based on the attention mechanism, AIM can select microblogs with the largest attention values for misinformation identification.
G07.1		2962981892	G07.1_2962981892_9	The attention mechanism in AIM contains two parts: content attention and dynamic attention.
G07.1		2962981892	G07.1_2962981892_10	Content attention is the calculated-based textual features of each microblog.
G07.1		2962981892	G07.1_2962981892_11	Dynamic attention is related to the time interval between the posting time of a microblog and the beginning of the event.
G07.1		2962981892	G07.1_2962981892_12	To evaluate AIM, we conduct a series of experiments on the Weibo and Twitter datasets, and the experimental results show that the proposed AIM model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
G07.1		2683299720	G07.1_2683299720_1	With the rapid growth of social media, massive misinformation is also spreading widely on social media, such as microblog, and bring negative effects to human life.
G07.1		2683299720	G07.1_2683299720_2	Nowadays, automatic misinformation identification has drawn attention from academic and industrial communities.
G07.1		2683299720	G07.1_2683299720_3	For an event on social media usually consists of multiple microblogs, current methods are mainly based on global statistical features.
G07.1		2683299720	G07.1_2683299720_4	However, information on social media is full of noisy and outliers, which should be alleviated.
G07.1		2683299720	G07.1_2683299720_5	Moreover, most of microblogs about an event have little contribution to the identification of misinformation, where useful information can be easily overwhelmed by useless information.
G07.1		2683299720	G07.1_2683299720_6	Thus, it is important to mine significant microblogs for a reliable misinformation identification method.
G07.1		2683299720	G07.1_2683299720_7	In this paper, we propose an Attention-based approach for Identification of Misinformation (AIM).
G07.1		2683299720	G07.1_2683299720_8	Based on the attention mechanism, AIM can select microblogs with largest attention values for misinformation identification.
G07.1		2683299720	G07.1_2683299720_9	The attention mechanism in AIM contains two parts: content attention and dynamic attention.
G07.1		2683299720	G07.1_2683299720_10	Content attention is calculated based textual features of each microblog.
G07.1		2683299720	G07.1_2683299720_11	Dynamic attention is related to the time interval between the posting time of a microblog and the beginning of the event.
G07.1		2683299720	G07.1_2683299720_12	To evaluate AIM, we conduct a series of experiments on the Weibo dataset and the Twitter dataset, and the experimental results show that the proposed AIM model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
G07.1		2296380453	G07.1_2296380453_1	In this paper, we study the Misinformation Containment (MC) problem.
G07.1		2296380453	G07.1_2296380453_2	In particular, taking into account the faster development of misinformation detection techniques, we mainly focus on the limiting the misinformation with known sources case.
G07.1		2296380453	G07.1_2296380453_3	We prove that under the Competitive Activation Model, the MC problem is NP-hard and show that it cannot be approximated in polynomial time within a ratio of \({e}/(e-1)\) unless \(NP \subseteq DTIME (n^{O(\log \log n)})\).
G07.1		2296380453	G07.1_2296380453_4	Due to its hardness, we propose an effective algorithm, exploiting the critical nodes and using the greedy approach as well as applying the CELF heuristic to achieve the goal.
G07.1		2296380453	G07.1_2296380453_5	Comprehensive experiments on real social networks are conducted, and results show that our algorithm can effectively expand the awareness of correct information as well as limit the spread of misinformation.
G07.1		2296336795	G07.1_2296336795_1	Mobile Opportunistic Networks (MONs) are effective solutions to uphold communications in the situations where traditional communication networks are unavailable.
G07.1		2296336795	G07.1_2296336795_2	However, MONs can be abused to disseminate misinformation causing undesirable effects in public.
G07.1		2296336795	G07.1_2296336795_3	To prevent misinformation from propagating, we first propose a formal model to formulate the process of misinformation propagation based on the ordinary differential equation.
G07.1		2296336795	G07.1_2296336795_4	Secondly, we explore a general framework to describe the random mobility of nodes, and derive a new contact rate between nodes.
G07.1		2296336795	G07.1_2296336795_5	Thirdly, we propose a double pulse control strategy of vaccination and treatment for inhibiting misinformation propagation.
G07.1		2296336795	G07.1_2296336795_6	Moreover, a novel pulse control model of misinformation propagation is developed based on the impulsive differential equation.
G07.1		2296336795	G07.1_2296336795_7	Finally, through the derivation and stability analysis of a misinformation-free period solution of the proposed model, we obtain a threshold upon which misinformation dies out.
G07.1		2296336795	G07.1_2296336795_8	The simulation results validate our theoretical analysis.
G07.1		2898367945	G07.1_2898367945_1	While online social networks (OSNs) have become an important platform for information exchange, the abuse of OSNs to spread misinformation has become a significant threat to our society.
G07.1		2898367945	G07.1_2898367945_2	To restrain the propagation of misinformation in its early stages, we study the Distance-constrained Misinformation Combat under Uncertainty problem, which aims to both reduce the spread of misinformation and enhance the spread of correct information within a given propagation distance.
G07.1		2898367945	G07.1_2898367945_3	The problem formulation considers the competitive diffusion of misinformation and correct information.
G07.1		2898367945	G07.1_2898367945_4	It also accounts for the uncertainty in identifying initial misinformation adopters.
G07.1		2898367945	G07.1_2898367945_5	For competitive propagation with major-threshold activation, we propose a solution based on stochastic programming and provide an upper-bound in the presence of uncertainty.
G07.1		2898367945	G07.1_2898367945_6	We propose an efficient Combat Seed Selection algorithm to tackle general-threshold activation, in which we define a measure, “effectiveness”, to evaluate the contribution of nodes to the fight against misinformation.
G07.1		2898367945	G07.1_2898367945_7	Through extensive experiments, we validate that our algorithm outputs high-quality solution with very fast computation.

G07.1		2182204071	G07.1_2182204071_1	Introduction.
G07.1		2182204071	G07.1_2182204071_2	People enjoy sharing information, even when they do not believe it.
G07.1		2182204071	G07.1_2182204071_3	Thus, misinformation (inaccurate information) and disinformation (deceptive information) diffuse throughout social networks, as misinforming and disinforming are varieties of information behaviour.
G07.1		2182204071	G07.1_2182204071_4	Social media have made such diffusion easier and faster.
G07.1		2182204071	G07.1_2182204071_5	Many information behaviour models, however, suggest a normative model of information as true, accurate, complete, despite the ubiquity of misinformation and disinformation.
G07.1		2182204071	G07.1_2182204071_6	Analysis.
G07.1		2182204071	G07.1_2182204071_7	Misinformation and disinformation are defined and we show how they extend the concept of information through their informativeness.
G07.1		2182204071	G07.1_2182204071_8	Table 1 summarizes the features of information, misinformation, and disinformation.
G07.1		2182204071	G07.1_2182204071_9	Figure 1 illustrates the social diffusion process by which misinforming and disinforming function as types of information behaviour.
G07.1		2182204071	G07.1_2182204071_10	Conclusion.
G07.1		2182204071	G07.1_2182204071_11	Misinformation and disinformation are closely linked to information literacy, especially in terms of how they are diffused and shared and how people use both cues to credibility and cues to deception to make judgements.
G07.1		2182204071	G07.1_2182204071_12	Misinformation and disinformation present both challenges and opportunities for individuals, businesses, and governments.
G07.1		2182204071	G07.1_2182204071_13	Future work in immersive, 3D virtual worlds takes a naturalistic approach to understand the principal elements of cues to misinformation and disinformation.
G07.1		2951403090	G07.1_2951403090_1	We present Verifi2, a visual analytic system to support the investigation of misinformation on social media.
G07.1		2951403090	G07.1_2951403090_2	On the one hand, social media platforms empower individuals and organizations by democratizing the sharing of information.
G07.1		2951403090	G07.1_2951403090_3	On the other hand, even well-informed and experienced social media users are vulnerable to misinformation.
G07.1		2951403090	G07.1_2951403090_4	To address the issue, various models and studies have emerged from multiple disciplines to detect and understand the effects of misinformation.
G07.1		2951403090	G07.1_2951403090_5	However, there is still a lack of intuitive and accessible tools that help social media users distinguish misinformation from verified news.
G07.1		2951403090	G07.1_2951403090_6	In this paper, we present Verifi2, a visual analytic system that uses state-of-the-art computational methods to highlight salient features from text, social network, and images.
G07.1		2951403090	G07.1_2951403090_7	By exploring news on a source level through multiple coordinated views in Verifi2, users can interact with the complex dimensions that characterize misinformation and contrast how real and suspicious news outlets differ on these dimensions.
G07.1		2951403090	G07.1_2951403090_8	To evaluate Verifi2, we conduct interviews with experts in digital media, journalism, education, psychology, and computing who study misinformation.
G07.1		2951403090	G07.1_2951403090_9	Our interviews show promising potential for Verifi2 to serve as an educational tool on misinformation.
G07.1		2951403090	G07.1_2951403090_10	Furthermore, our interview results highlight the complexity of the problem of combating misinformation and call for more work from the visualization community.

G07.1		1204344257	G07.1_1204344257_1	On setting of general information (i.e.without probability) we define, by axiomatic way, general misinformation of an event.
G07.1		1204344257	G07.1_1204344257_2	We give a class of measures of misinformation, solving a sistem of functional equations, given by the properties of the misinformation.
G07.1		2796133082	G07.1_2796133082_1	These days, news regarding various events and accidents are reported quickly through internet and applications.
G07.1		2796133082	G07.1_2796133082_2	Although most of the breaking news are accurate, the news of ongoing events may deliver the misinformation as the circumstances may change.
G07.1		2796133082	G07.1_2796133082_3	Although the misinformation is corrected afterwards, people tend to be influenced continually by previous misinformation.
G07.1		2796133082	G07.1_2796133082_4	Therefore, this study aims to find out what characteristics of news chatbot agent are effective in making correction message.
G07.1		2796133082	G07.1_2796133082_5	The result shows that the silent news chatbot is more likely to lead people to be influenced by misinformation than news chatbot which also mentions a few words when they are required to give information.
G07.1		2996462675	G07.1_2996462675_1	Misinformation is considered one of the most critical challenges of recent years.
G07.1		2996462675	G07.1_2996462675_2	Despite all the attempts, the automatic detection of misinformation still remains an open problem.
G07.1		2996462675	G07.1_2996462675_3	Although misinformation and fake news exist for a long period of time, the ubiquitousness of social media has facilitated their propagation with severe consequences for the society.
G07.1		2996462675	G07.1_2996462675_4	For example, the “Pizzagate” shooting incident was a result of fake news that went viral claiming the involvement of a restaurant in human trafficking.
G07.1		2996462675	G07.1_2996462675_5	This talk will focus on the topic of misinformation detection.
G07.1		2996462675	G07.1_2996462675_6	First, I will introduce the concept and characteristics of the different types of misinformation and disinformation such as fake news, satire, rumours that go viral in online social networks.
G07.1		2996462675	G07.1_2996462675_7	Then, I will present some of the most recent detection approaches with a particular focus on approaches that exploit psycho-linguistic information (i.e., emotion, sentiment, informal language).
G07.1		2996462675	G07.1_2996462675_8	Finally, I will discuss challenges and open issues in the field of misinformation detection.
G07.1		2945588609	G07.1_2945588609_1	With billions of users, social networks have become the go to platform for information diffusion for news media outlets.
G07.1		2945588609	G07.1_2945588609_2	Lately, certain entities (users and/or organizations) have been active in generating misinformation in order to attract users to their respective websites, to generate online advertisement revenues, to increase followers, to create political instability, etc.
G07.1		2945588609	G07.1_2945588609_3	With the increasing presence of misinformation on social networks, it is becoming increasingly difficult to not only distinguish between information and misinformation, but also, to identify the source(s) of misinformation propagation.
G07.1		2945588609	G07.1_2945588609_4	This effort reviews my doctoral research on identifying the source(s) of misinformation propagation.
G07.1		2945588609	G07.1_2945588609_5	Particularly, I utilize the mathematical concept of Identifying Codes to uniquely identify users who become active in propagating misinformation.
G07.1		2945588609	G07.1_2945588609_6	In this paper, I formally present the computation of the Minimum Identifying Code Set (MICS) as a novel variation of the traditional Graph Coloring problem.
G07.1		2945588609	G07.1_2945588609_7	Furthermore, I present an Integer Linear Program for the computation of the MICS.
G07.1		2945588609	G07.1_2945588609_8	I apply the technique on various anonymous Facebook network datasets and show the effectiveness of the approach.
G07.1		2488003928	G07.1_2488003928_1	Online Social Networks (OSNs) constitute one of the most important communication channels and are widely utilized as news sources.
G07.1		2488003928	G07.1_2488003928_2	Information spreads widely and rapidly in OSNs through the word-of-mouth effect.
G07.1		2488003928	G07.1_2488003928_3	However, it is not uncommon for misinformation to propagate in the network.
G07.1		2488003928	G07.1_2488003928_4	Misinformation dissemination may lead to undesirable effects, especially in cases where the non-credible information concerns emergency events.
G07.1		2488003928	G07.1_2488003928_5	Therefore, it is essential to timely limit the propagation of misinformation.
G07.1		2488003928	G07.1_2488003928_6	Towards this goal, we suggest a novel propagation model, namely the Dynamic Linear Threshold (DLT) model, that effectively captures the way contradictory information, i.e., misinformation and credible information, propagates in the network.
G07.1		2488003928	G07.1_2488003928_7	The DLT model considers the probability of a user alternating between competing beliefs, assisting in either the propagation of misinformation or credible news.
G07.1		2488003928	G07.1_2488003928_8	Based on the DLT model, we formulate an optimization problem that aims in identifying the most appropriate subset of users to limit the spread of misinformation by initiating the propagation of credible information.
G07.1		2488003928	G07.1_2488003928_9	Through extensive experimental evaluation we demonstrate that our approach outperforms its competitors.
G08.1		2402373891	G08.1_2402373891_1	We present, Fawkescoin, a simple cryptocurrency using no public-key cryptography.
G08.1		2402373891	G08.1_2402373891_2	Our proposal utilizes the distributed consensus mechanism of Bitcoin but for transactions replaces Bitcoin’s ECDSA signatures with hash-based Guy Fawkes signatures.
G08.1		2402373891	G08.1_2402373891_3	While this introduces a number of complexities, it demonstrates that a distributed cryptocurrency is in fact possible with only symmetric cryptographic operations with no dramatic loss of efficiency overall and several efficiency gains.
G08.1		2957710009	G08.1_2957710009_1	In this paper, we address the performance analysis of Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based cryptocurrency on the basis of its native structure.
G08.1		2957710009	G08.1_2957710009_2	Several attempts on existing blockchain-based cryptocurrencies to resolve the limitation of the transaction processing rate has resulted in numerous form of solutions, such as side-chain, off-chain or data sharding.
G08.1		2957710009	G08.1_2957710009_3	While those efforts are dedicated to overcome the limitation that the one-dimensional data structure has, a two-dimensional form of distributed ledger as known as DAG-based cryptocurrency has been emerged.
G08.1		2957710009	G08.1_2957710009_4	Comparing with blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, DAG-based cryptocurrencies feature relatively faster issuance and confirmation of the transactions due to the individual processing method of the transactions.
G08.1		2957710009	G08.1_2957710009_5	However, existing DAG-based cryptocurrencies also suffer from the instability of the performance, since the confirmation or validation delay can be varied by network condition such as transaction incoming rate.
G08.1		2957710009	G08.1_2957710009_6	We derive the generic performance model of DAG-based cryptocurrency while varying the parameters.
G08.1		2957710009	G08.1_2957710009_7	From the derived models, we propose some novel strategies to improve the performance of the DAG-based cryptocurrency system which encourages the participants of the cryptocurrency (both traders and nodes) to boost the transaction processing speed while keeping the ledger healthy.
G08.1		2957710009	G08.1_2957710009_8	We show the effectiveness of our proposal by numerical statistics obtained by simulation, which results in maximum 46 percent of increase in our case.
G08.1		2588749731	G08.1_2588749731_1	In this paper, we propose a digital cash system named Blockchain-LI.
G08.1		2588749731	G08.1_2588749731_2	This is an activity-based micro-pricing system implemented on cryptocurrency technologies.
G08.1		2588749731	G08.1_2588749731_3	Activity-based micro-pricing is a pervasive technology to influence peopleu0027s behavior through economic incentives.
G08.1		2588749731	G08.1_2588749731_4	Implementing activity-based micro-pricing based on cryptocurrency technologies enables us to solve potential technical issues of traditional implementation.
G08.1		2588749731	G08.1_2588749731_5	The Blockchain-LI architecture adopts a hierarchical currency network containing two types of currencies.
G08.1		2588749731	G08.1_2588749731_6	The public coin is widely prevalent and has high integrity.
G08.1		2588749731	G08.1_2588749731_7	The private coins are low integrity digital currencies that connect to the public coin.
G08.1		2588749731	G08.1_2588749731_8	This approach enables us to solve cryptocurrency problems including scalability and block size.
G08.1		2588749731	G08.1_2588749731_9	However, to use Blockchain-LI as a social infrastructure system, unresolved problems remain.
G08.1		2588749731	G08.1_2588749731_10	This paper proposes sustainability, conversion protocols, and security issues as topics for future study.
G08.1		2998001460	G08.1_2998001460_1	We study the problem of predicting whether the price of the 21 most popular cryptocurrencies (according to coinmarketcap.com) will go up or down on day d, using data up to day d-1.
G08.1		2998001460	G08.1_2998001460_2	Our C2P2 algorithm is the first algorithm to consider the fact that the price of a cryptocurrency c might depend not only on historical prices, sentiments, global stock indices, but also on the prices and predicted prices of other cryptocurrencies.
G08.1		2998001460	G08.1_2998001460_3	C2P2 therefore does not predict cryptocurrency prices one coin at a time - rather it uses similarity metrics in conjunction with collective classification to compare multiple cryptocurrency features to jointly predict the cryptocurrency prices for all 21 coins considered.
G08.1		2998001460	G08.1_2998001460_4	We show that our C2P2 algorithm beats out a recent competing 2017 paper by margins varying from 5.1-83% and another Bitcoin-specific prediction paper from 2018 by 16%.
G08.1		2998001460	G08.1_2998001460_5	In both cases, C2P2 is the winner on all cryptocurrencies considered.
G08.1		2998001460	G08.1_2998001460_6	Moreover, we experimentally show that the use of similarity metrics within our C2P2 algorithm leads to a direct improvement for 20 out of 21 cryptocurrencies ranging from 0.4% to 17.8%.
G08.1		2998001460	G08.1_2998001460_7	Without the similarity component, C2P2 still beats competitors on 20 out of 21 cryptocurrencies considered.
G08.1		2998001460	G08.1_2998001460_8	We show that all these results are statistically significant via a Studentu0027s t-test with p u003c 10^-5.
G08.1		2809527986	G08.1_2809527986_1	The dramatic increase of cryptocurrency price has reshaped the cyber security landscape.
G08.1		2809527986	G08.1_2809527986_2	Many IoT malwares are created, turning many kinds of infected IoT devices into crypto currency mining machines.
G08.1		2809527986	G08.1_2809527986_3	Crypto currency miner machines, dedicated IoT devices that are built for the sole purpose to mine cryptocurrencies, are also becoming hacker’s new target.
G08.1		2809527986	G08.1_2809527986_4	This paper describes how attackers are exploiting both the horizontal and vertical of aspects of IoT devices to mine cryptocurrency and proposed a method to evaluate the cost of such exploits.
G08.2		2229815206	G08.2_2229815206_1	We examine the make-take structure, which compensates liquidity suppliers and charges liquidity demanders, in the options markets where it competes with a traditional structure that uses payments for order flow.
G08.2		2229815206	G08.2_2229815206_2	Using the introduction of the make-take structure as an event, we find that execution costs (including fees) for liquidity demanders decline after the event for the affected options, that the make-take structure encourages market makers to improve quoted prices, and that brokers change their routing behavior to include fees in the routing decision.
G08.2		2229815206	G08.2_2229815206_3	The decline in execution costs is consistent with the benefits of the increased quote competition from the make-take structure prevailing over the fees the structure charges to liquidity demanders.
G08.2		2229815206	G08.2_2229815206_4	This paper was accepted by Wei Jiang, finance.
G08.2		2283004171	G08.2_2283004171_1	This paper provides the results of the effectiveness of the quantitative easing (QE) policy, including purchasing mortgage-backed securities, treasury securities, and other assets in the United States, on the financial markets of Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines (TIP) in the post-QE introduction period.
G08.2		2283004171	G08.2_2283004171_2	In this study, we focused on three different financial markets, which include the exchange rate market, stock market, and bond market.
G08.2		2283004171	G08.2_2283004171_3	We employed a Bayesian Markov-switching VAR model to study the transmission mechanisms of QE shocks between periods of expansion in the QE policy and turmoil with extraordinarily negative events in the financial markets and the global economy.
G08.2		2283004171	G08.2_2283004171_4	We found that QE may have a direct substantial effect on the TIP financial markets.
G08.2		2283004171	G08.2_2283004171_5	Therefore, if the Federal Reserve withdraws the QE policy, the move might also have an effect on the TIP financial market.
G08.2		2283004171	G08.2_2283004171_6	In particular, purchasing the mortgage-backed securities (MBS) program is more likely to affect the TIP financial markets than purchasing the other programs.
G08.2		2048506848	G08.2_2048506848_1	Abstract   Over the last two decades, many important changes took place in the area of international finance.
G08.2		2048506848	G08.2_2048506848_2	The liberalisation of financial markets and the development of powerful communication and trading facilities have enlarged the scope of selection for investors.
G08.2		2048506848	G08.2_2048506848_3	Most financial markets of major developed countries must be regarded as highly integrated now.
G08.2		2048506848	G08.2_2048506848_4	Traditional capital market theory has also changed and methods of financial analysis have been improved considerably.
G08.2		2048506848	G08.2_2048506848_5	The existence of non-linearities in financial market movements has been emphasized by various researchers and financial analysts over the last years.
G08.2		2048506848	G08.2_2048506848_6	Taking both aspects into account, a new kind of financial analysis seems to be necessary: the non-linear analysis of integrated financial markets.
G08.2		2048506848	G08.2_2048506848_7	Recent developments in the theory of neural computation provide interesting mathematical tools for such a new kind of financial analysis.
G08.2		2048506848	G08.2_2048506848_8	This paper presents both the economic approach to an analysis of highly integrated financial markets and the econometric methods, especially artificial neural networks (ANN), to realize it.
G08.2		2048506848	G08.2_2048506848_9	Forecasting of any asset class, e.g.
G08.2		2048506848	G08.2_2048506848_10	stock, bond or exchange rate prediction, now becomes an integrated part within such a wider global capital market equilibrium.
G08.2		2048506848	G08.2_2048506848_11	ANN, especially recurrent networks, are used to model integrated financial markets.
G08.2		2048506848	G08.2_2048506848_12	This approach tries to develop a ‘world’ model of integrated financial markets.
G08.2		2048506848	G08.2_2048506848_13	The ‘world’ consists of the stock, bond and currency markets of the United States, Japan and Germany.
G08.2		2048506848	G08.2_2048506848_14	Traditional econometric methods as well as ANN are used to develop various kinds of models, which in turn are rated by their ability to provide accurate forecasts for these financial markets in an out-of-sample test.
G08.2		2073652521	G08.2_2073652521_1	Abstract   Recent studies by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and by academics have provided empirical evidence that Nasdaq trade execution costs are still higher than, for instance, on the NYSE.
G08.2		2073652521	G08.2_2073652521_2	Introducing decimal pricing is one concrete plan to enhance Nasdaq’s competitiveness.
G08.2		2073652521	G08.2_2073652521_3	However, effects of tick size changes are difficult to predict.
G08.2		2073652521	G08.2_2073652521_4	For that reason models have been required for quite a while.
G08.2		2073652521	G08.2_2073652521_5	Capital market synergetics is appropriate to investigate the effects of market microstructure changes.
G08.2		2073652521	G08.2_2073652521_6	In this paper, we examine the impact of a variation in Nasdaq’s minimum price increment on quoted spreads.
G08.2		2073652521	G08.2_2073652521_7	First, our findings confirm the numerical value of the decline in the average quoted spread in 1997 as an immediate effect of reducing the tick size from $1/8 to $1/16.
G08.2		2073652521	G08.2_2073652521_8	This strongly affirms the reliability of our calculation results.
G08.2		2073652521	G08.2_2073652521_9	Second, by applying the same research design again, we investigate the impact of a further reduction in the tick size to $1/100.
G08.2		2073652521	G08.2_2073652521_10	No such study is available at the moment.
G08.2		2073652521	G08.2_2073652521_11	The expected changes in the average quoted spreads due to the reduction in the tick size from $1/16 to $1/100, the change through decimalization, range from an increase of 2.82% to a decrease of 15.51%.
G08.2		2073652521	G08.2_2073652521_12	Derived by applying the same method again, the figures embody a reliable forecast of the real effects and are therefore of eminent importance to academics and to practitioners as well.
G08.2		1901849648	G08.2_1901849648_1	In the last years efforts in econophysics have been shifted to study how network theory can facilitate understanding of complex financial markets.
G08.2		1901849648	G08.2_1901849648_2	Main part of these efforts is the study of correlation-based hierarchical networks.
G08.2		1901849648	G08.2_1901849648_3	This is somewhat surprising as the underlying assumptions of research looking at financial markets is that they behave chaotically.
G08.2		1901849648	G08.2_1901849648_4	In fact itu0027s common for econophysicists to estimate maximal Lyapunov exponent for log returns of a given financial asset to confirm that prices behave chaotically.
G08.2		1901849648	G08.2_1901849648_5	Chaotic behaviour is only displayed by dynamical systems which are either non-linear or infinite-dimensional.
G08.2		1901849648	G08.2_1901849648_6	Therefore it seems that non-linearity is an important part of financial markets, which is proved by numerous studies confirming financial markets display significant non-linear behaviour, yet network theory is used to study them using almost exclusively correlations and partial correlations, which are inherently dealing with linear dependencies only.
G08.2		1901849648	G08.2_1901849648_7	In this paper we introduce a way to incorporate non-linear dynamics and dependencies into hierarchical networks to study financial markets using mutual information and its dynamical extension: the mutual information rate.
G08.2		1901849648	G08.2_1901849648_8	We estimate it using multidimensional Lempel-Ziv complexity and then convert it into an Euclidean metric in order to find appropriate topological structure of networks modelling financial markets.
G08.2		1901849648	G08.2_1901849648_9	We show that this approach leads to different results than correlation-based approach used in most studies, on the basis of 15 biggest companies listed on Warsaw Stock Exchange in the period of 2009-2012 and 91 companies listed on NYSE100 between 2003 and 2013, using minimal spanning trees and planar maximally filtered graphs.
G08.2		2751845184	G08.2_2751845184_1	The inability of investors and academics to consistently predict, and understand the behavior of financial markets has forced the search for alternative analytical frameworks.
G08.2		2751845184	G08.2_2751845184_2	Analyzing financial markets as complex systems is a framework that has demonstrated great promises, with the use of agent-based models (ABMs) and the inclusion of network science playing an important role in increasing the relevance of the framework.
G08.2		2751845184	G08.2_2751845184_3	Using an artificial stock market created via an ABM, this paper provides a significant insight into the mechanisms that drive the returns in financial markets, including periods of elevated prices and excess volatility.
G08.2		2751845184	G08.2_2751845184_4	The paper demonstrates that the network topology that investors form and the dividend policy of firms significantly affect the behavior of the market.
G08.2		2751845184	G08.2_2751845184_5	However, if investors have a bias to following their neighbors then the topology becomes redundant.
G08.2		2751845184	G08.2_2751845184_6	By successfully addressing these issues this paper helps refine and shape a variety of additional research tasks for the use of ABMs in uncovering the dynamics of financial markets.
G08.2		2161885005	G08.2_2161885005_1	Abstract   This paper shows that the inability of principals to commit to long-term contracts is irrelevant when dealing with several agents whose private information is correlated.
G08.2		2161885005	G08.2_2161885005_2	This sharply contrasts with the dynamics of contracting without such correlation.
G08.2		2161885005	G08.2_2161885005_3	The paper also explores what limitations on yardstick mechanisms can justify the use of long-term contracts.
G08.2		2161885005	G08.2_2161885005_4	We found that the inability of a principal to commit not to renegotiate long-term contracts is without consequence even if there is a bound on transfers that an agent can be asked to pay.
G08.2		2161885005	G08.2_2161885005_5	In contrast, short-term contracting fails to implement the commitment solution with constraints on transfers.
G08.2		2161885005	G08.2_2161885005_6	Second, absent current yardstick, the possibility of using correlated mechanisms in the future allows the principal to implement the first-best with a renegotiation-proof long-term contract whereas this cannot be achieved with short-term contracting.
G08.2		2163689154	G08.2_2163689154_1	OR techniques are applied to nonportfolio problems in financial markets, such as the equity, debt, and foreign exchange markets and the corresponding derivatives markets.
G08.2		2163689154	G08.2_2163689154_2	Finance problems are an excellent application area for OR researchers.
G08.2		2163689154	G08.2_2163689154_3	OR techniques are used to value financial instruments, identify market imperfections, design securities, regulate markets, evaluate and control risks, model strategic problems, and understand the functioning of financial markets.
G08.2		2163689154	G08.2_2163689154_4	Mathematical programming is probably the most widely applied OR technique, but Monte Carlo simulation methods are of increasing importance.
G08.2		2163689154	G08.2_2163689154_5	With the improvements in the real-time availability of data and the power of computers, the role of OR techniques in financial markets can only increase.
G08.2		2168756354	G08.2_2168756354_1	Current attempts to analyze international financial markets include the use of financial technical analysis and data mining techniques.
G08.2		2168756354	G08.2_2168756354_2	In this paper, we propose a new approach that incorporates implication networks and association rules to form an associated network structure.
G08.2		2168756354	G08.2_2168756354_3	The proposed approach explicitly addresses the issue of local vs. global influences between financial markets.
G08.2		1542120229	G08.2_1542120229_1	We propose a new welfare criterion that allows us to rank alternative financial market structures in the presence of belief heterogeneity.
G08.2		1542120229	G08.2_1542120229_2	We analyze economies with complete and incomplete financial markets and/or restricted trading possibilities in the form of borrowing limits or transaction costs.
G08.2		1542120229	G08.2_1542120229_3	We describe circumstances under which various restrictions on financial markets are desirable according to our welfare criterion.
G08.2		2766677781	G08.2_2766677781_1	The behavior of financial markets has frustrated, and continues to frustrate, investors and academics.
G08.2		2766677781	G08.2_2766677781_2	By utilizing a complex systems framework, researchers have discovered new fields of investigations that have provided meaningful insight into the behavior of financial markets.
G08.2		2766677781	G08.2_2766677781_3	The use of agent-based models (ABMs) and the inclusion of network science have played an important role in increasing the relevance of the complex systems to financial markets.
G08.2		2766677781	G08.2_2766677781_4	The challenge of how best to combine these new techniques to produce meaningful results that can be accepted by the broader community remains an issue.
G08.2		2766677781	G08.2_2766677781_5	By implementing an artificial stock market that utilizes an Ising model based agent-based model (ABM), this paper provides insights into the mechanisms that drive the returns in financial markets, including periods of elevated prices and excess volatility.
G08.2		2766677781	G08.2_2766677781_6	A key finding is that the network topology investors form significantly affects the behavior of the market, with the exception being if investors have a bias to following their neighbors, at which point the topology becomes redundant.
G08.2		2766677781	G08.2_2766677781_7	The model also investigates the impact of introducing multiple risky assets, something that has been absent in previous attempts.
G08.2		2766677781	G08.2_2766677781_8	By successfully addressing these issues this paper helps to refine and shape a variety of further research tasks for the use of ABMs in uncovering the dynamics of financial markets.
G08.2		2509518867	G08.2_2509518867_1	A financial market is a complex, dynamic system with an underlying governing manifold.
G08.2		2509518867	G08.2_2509518867_2	This study introduces an early warning method for financial markets based on manifold learning.
G08.2		2509518867	G08.2_2509518867_3	First, we restructure the phase space of a financial system using financial time series data.
G08.2		2509518867	G08.2_2509518867_4	Then, we propose an information metric-based manifold learning (IMML) algorithm to extract the intrinsic manifold of a dynamic financial system.
G08.2		2509518867	G08.2_2509518867_5	Early warning ranges for critical transitions of financial markets can be detected from the underlying manifold.
G08.2		2509518867	G08.2_2509518867_6	We deduce the intrinsic geometric properties of the manifold to detect impending crises.
G08.2		2509518867	G08.2_2509518867_7	Experimental results show that our IMML algorithm accurately describes the attractor manifold of the financial dynamic system, and contributes to inform investors about the state of financial markets.
G08.2		1985066676	G08.2_1985066676_1	In this paper an arbitrage-free n-period model of a financial market with a predictable, strictly positive numeraire and g risky assets is considered.
G08.2		1985066676	G08.2_1985066676_2	Complete financial markets are of great practical relevance and of considerable theoretical interest, because in these markets one can find hedging strategies and unique arbitrage-free prices.
G08.2		1985066676	G08.2_1985066676_3	In this paper complete financial markets are characterized by the simple condition of “call-completeness”.
G08.2		2128348705	G08.2_2128348705_1	Agent-based artificial financial markets are an area of increasing interest in computational finance.
G08.2		2128348705	G08.2_2128348705_2	Recent work by LeBaron and Yamamoto proposes an order-driven market model based on evolutionary algorithm based artificial agents.
G08.2		2128348705	G08.2_2128348705_3	In this paper, we present a mechanism for incorporating elements of swarm intelligence into this model, and find that our model produces market price behavior that, in some ways, is closer to that of real financial markets.
G09.1		1568674730	G09.1_1568674730_1	The proper generation and preservation of digital data from Event Data Recorders (EDRs) can provide invaluable evidence to automobile crash reconstruction investigations.
G09.1		1568674730	G09.1_1568674730_2	However, data collected from the EDR can be difficult to use and authenticate, complicating the presentation of such information as evidence in legal proceedings.
G09.1		1568674730	G09.1_1568674730_3	Indeed, current techniques for removing and preserving such data do not meet the courtâ€™s standards for electronic evidence.
G09.1		1568674730	G09.1_1568674730_4	Experimentation with an EDR unit from a 2001 GMC Sierra pickup truck highlighted particular issues with repeatability of results.
G09.1		1568674730	G09.1_1568674730_5	Fortunately, advances in the digital forensics field and memory technology can be applied to EDR analysis in order to provide more complete and usable data.
G09.1		1568674730	G09.1_1568674730_6	The presented issues should assist in the identification and development of a model for forensically sound collection and investigation techniques for EDRs.
G09.1		2064326940	G09.1_2064326940_1	It has been shown that most phishing sites are created by means of a vulnerable web server being re-purposed by a phisher to host a counterfeit website without the knowledge of the serveru0027s owner.
G09.1		2064326940	G09.1_2064326940_2	In this paper, we examine common vulnerabilities which allow these phishing sites to be created and suggest a method for identifying common attack methods, as well as, help inform webmasters and their hosting companies in ways that help them to defend their servers.
G09.1		2064326940	G09.1_2064326940_3	Our method involves applying a Longest Common Substring algorithm to known phishing URLs, and investigating the results of that string to identify common vulnerabilities, exploits, and attack tools which may be prevalent among those who hack servers for phishing.
G09.1		2064326940	G09.1_2064326940_4	Following a Case Study approach, we then select four prevalent attacks that are suggested by our methodology, and use our findings to identify the underlying vulnerability, and document statistics showing that these vulnerabilities are responsible for the creation of phishing websites.
G09.1		2064326940	G09.1_2064326940_5	Digging further, we identify attack tools created to exploit these vulnerabilities and how they are detected by current intrusion detection signatures.
G09.1		2064326940	G09.1_2064326940_6	We suggest a means by which this work could be integrated with Intrusion Detection Systems to allow webmasters or hosting providers to reduce their vulnerability to hosting phishing websites.
G09.1		1956834750	G09.1_1956834750_1	This paper presents a new development in the forensics of software copyright through a juxtaposed comparison between the proven AFC test and the recent POSAR test, the two forensic procedures for establishing software copyright infringement cases.
G09.1		1956834750	G09.1_1956834750_2	First, the paper separately overviews the 3-stage, linear sequential AFC test and then the 5-phase, cyclic POSAR test (as AFC’s logical extension).
G09.1		1956834750	G09.1_1956834750_3	The paper then compares the processes involved in each of the 5 phases of the POSAR test with the processes involved in the 3 stages in the AFC test, for the benefit of forensic practitioners and researchers.
G09.1		1956834750	G09.1_1956834750_4	Finally, the paper discusses some common areas where both the tests will need careful handling while implementing them in the judiciaries across the world.
G09.1		1824047601	G09.1_1824047601_1	As cloud computing gains a firm foothold as an information technology (IT) business solution, an increasing number of enterprises are considering it as a possible migration route for their IT infrastructures and business operations.
G09.1		1824047601	G09.1_1824047601_2	The centralization of data in the cloud has not gone unnoticed by criminal elements and, as such, data centers and cloud providers have become targets for attack.
G09.1		1824047601	G09.1_1824047601_3	Traditional digital forensic methodologies are not well suited to cloud computing environments because of the use of remote storage and virtualization technologies.
G09.1		1824047601	G09.1_1824047601_4	The task of imaging potential evidence is further complicated by evolving cloud environments and services such as infrastructure as a service (IaaS), software as a service (SaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS).
G09.1		1824047601	G09.1_1824047601_5	The implementation of forensics as a service (FaaS) appears to be the only workable solution, but until standards are formulated and implemented by service providers, the only option will be to use traditional forensic tools and rely on service level agreements to facilitate the extraction of digital evidence on demand.
G09.1		1824047601	G09.1_1824047601_6	This paper explores the effect that cloud computing has on traditional digital forensic investigations and proposes some approaches to help improve cloud forensic investigations.
G09.1		1938834256	G09.1_1938834256_1	Almost every day we can observe that most of people spend quite a long time in traffic environment.
G09.1		1938834256	G09.1_1938834256_2	In the course of driving, motorists occasionally desire to get traditional travel information, such as traffic, road, car and safety related driving data.
G09.1		1938834256	G09.1_1938834256_3	In the near future, we shall quite likely mention about new generation drivers who wish to get social based data and its manipulation.
G09.1		1938834256	G09.1_1938834256_4	Hence, we should develop new driver necessity strategies satisfying Internet based requirements of new generation drivers.
G09.1		1938834256	G09.1_1938834256_5	Here, we propose a system offering sub-trip options without ruining driveru0027s primary trip plan.
G09.1		1938834256	G09.1_1938834256_6	In fact, we consider driving efficiency taking pleasure in driving by means of social computing rather exploiting traditional data manipulations such as safe driving, fuel-efficient driving, and obtaining traffic data.
G09.1		1938834256	G09.1_1938834256_7	For the sake of new generation driver wishes, we develop a model using trip data and feedback information provided by drivers earlier visiting intended attraction place.
G09.1		1938834256	G09.1_1938834256_8	Then, we utilize a social platform associated with central server holding social data such as road safety, weather conditions, and satisfaction rate of attraction place.
G09.1		1938834256	G09.1_1938834256_9	In this study, we earlier define driver profiles as gourmand, shopaholic, adventurer, art lover, and technophile.
G09.1		1938834256	G09.1_1938834256_10	Therefore, we propose a system satisfying possible sub-trip expectations of drivers having different profiles.
G09.1		1938834256	G09.1_1938834256_11	Eventually, we have modeled a new generation inter car sub-route advice platform for pleasant and efficient trip.
G09.1		2123025315	G09.1_2123025315_1	This paper presents a study of 25 structural features extracted from samples of grapheme ‘thu0027 that correspond to features commonly used by forensic document examiners.
G09.1		2123025315	G09.1_2123025315_2	Most of the features are extracted using vector skeletons produced by a specially developed skeletonisation algorithm.
G09.1		2123025315	G09.1_2123025315_3	The methods of feature extraction are presented along with the results.
G09.1		2123025315	G09.1_2123025315_4	Analysis of the usefulness of the features was conducted and three categories of features were identified: indispensable, partially relevant and irrelevant for determining the authorship of genuine unconstrained handwriting.
G09.1		2123025315	G09.1_2123025315_5	The division was performed based on searching the optimal feature sets using the wrapper method.
G09.1		2123025315	G09.1_2123025315_6	A constructive neural network was used as a classifier and a genetic algorithm was used to search for optimal feature sets.
G09.1		2123025315	G09.1_2123025315_7	It is shown that structural micro features similar to those used in forensic document analysis do possess discriminative power.
G09.1		2123025315	G09.1_2123025315_8	The results are also compared to those obtained in our preceding study, and it is shown that use of the vector skeletonisation allows both extraction of more structural features and improvement the feature extraction accuracy from 87% to 94%.
G09.1		2753992460	G09.1_2753992460_1	Recent technological advancements have made drones, also known as UAVs (Unmanned Air Vehicles), more accessible to the public, causing an increase in their popularity.
G09.1		2753992460	G09.1_2753992460_2	The potential applications of drones range from simple leisure and recreational purposes to photography, transport, surveying, security, the list goes on.
G09.1		2753992460	G09.1_2753992460_3	With the increase in demand and subsequent availability, there has also been a rise in drones used in crime.
G09.1		2753992460	G09.1_2753992460_4	This creates a need for forensic analysis into devices used for drones.
G09.1		2753992460	G09.1_2753992460_5	Due to the use of custom electronic flight systems within different drone devices, to date appropriate forensic tools have not been developed.
G09.1		2753992460	G09.1_2753992460_6	This paper covers the use of open source tools and the development of some basic scripts to aid forensic analysis of two popular drones — the DJI Phantom 3 Professional and AR Drone 2 with the aim of reconstructing the actions taken by these drones, identification of owners or operators, and extraction of data from associated mobile devices.
G09.1		2753992460	G09.1_2753992460_7	While different UAV systems can vary in their operations owing to their capabilities, some generic methods will be used in analysis and extraction of the data and then results will be compared between models.
G09.1		2139453858	G09.1_2139453858_1	Trust is easier to destroy than create, hence, trust in overly applied automation may erode following accidents.
G09.1		2139453858	G09.1_2139453858_2	This paper looks at the crash of a revolutionary supersonic fighter that resulted from over-reliance on protection technology.
G09.1		2139453858	G09.1_2139453858_3	The protection system has been automated to the extent that it was impossible for the pilot to regain control and convince the system that there was a problem.
G09.1		2139453858	G09.1_2139453858_4	Complete trust in the safety of the system has thus been translated into a new kind of computer-assisted error, where in the interest of safety the only possible exit strategy is outlawed by the system leading to the potential (or in this case, the actual) destruction of the system it was meant to protect.
G09.1		2139453858	G09.1_2139453858_5	Overall, trust appears to be an emergent function that takes in safety issues affecting the entire system as well as the relationship between the product, client and developer and the trade-offs that underpin decisions.
G09.1		2139453858	G09.1_2139453858_6	Operators, working as part of a system, abrogate some of their responsibility by implicitly or explicitly passing on control to computerised systems.
G09.1		2139453858	G09.1_2139453858_7	While operators function on as an integral part of systems, their trust in the ability and safety of the system plays a key role in the ensuing success or failure.
G09.1		2114369308	G09.1_2114369308_1	As an important part of computer forensics, network forensics particularly places emphasis on dynamic network information collection and proactive defense.
G09.1		2114369308	G09.1_2114369308_2	Most forensics systems based on intrusion detection or honeypot rarely emphasize the availability of actual servers.
G09.1		2114369308	G09.1_2114369308_3	In addition, few of them discussed the occasion of dynamic forensics particularly.
G09.1		2114369308	G09.1_2114369308_4	The work presented in this paper is based on an idea to assist dynamic forensics with intrusion tolerance and deception technology to enhance the availability of server system and gather more useful evidences on a proper occasion.
G09.1		2114369308	G09.1_2114369308_5	A mechanism of dynamic forensics based on intrusion forensics is proposed and is modeled with finite state machine.
G09.1		2114369308	G09.1_2114369308_6	The workflow is described.
G09.1		2114369308	G09.1_2114369308_7	A semi Markov process based on the embedded Markov chain of the states transition model is built and described.
G09.1		2114369308	G09.1_2114369308_8	Finally, the forensics capability and server availability are analysis.
G09.1		2114369308	G09.1_2114369308_9	According to the numerical analysis result, the security performance and forensics capability of the forensics system are enhanced to a certain degree.
G09.1		1555036802	G09.1_1555036802_1	The Internet of Things (IoT) involves numerous connected smart things with different technologies and communication standards.
G09.1		1555036802	G09.1_1555036802_2	While IoT opens new opportunities in various fields, it introduces new challenges in the field of digital forensics investigations.
G09.1		1555036802	G09.1_1555036802_3	The existing tools and procedures of digital forensics cannot meet the highly distributed and heterogeneous infrastructure of the IoT.
G09.1		1555036802	G09.1_1555036802_4	Forensics investigators will face challenges while identifying necessary pieces of evidence from the IoT environment, and collecting and analyzing those evidence.
G09.1		1555036802	G09.1_1555036802_5	In this article, we propose the first working definition of IoT forensics and systematically analyze the IoT forensics domain to explore the challenges and issues in this special branch of digital forensics.
G09.1		1555036802	G09.1_1555036802_6	We propose a Forensics-aware IoT (FAIoT) model for supporting reliable forensics investigations in the IoT environment.
G09.1		2113005368	G09.1_2113005368_1	Network forensics is a new approach for the network security, because the firewall and IDS cannot always stop and discover the misuse in the network.
G09.1		2113005368	G09.1_2113005368_2	Once the system is compromised, the forensics and investigation always after the attacks and lose some useful instant evidence.
G09.1		2113005368	G09.1_2113005368_3	The integrated analysis of the log and audit system and network traffic can lead to an efficient navigation of the traffic.
G09.1		2113005368	G09.1_2113005368_4	The current network forensics approaches only focus on the network traffic capture and traffic replay, which always result in the performance bottleneck or forensics analysis difficulties.
G09.1		2113005368	G09.1_2113005368_5	However, the adaptive capture without lose the potential sensitive traffic and real time investigation are seldom discussed.
G09.1		2113005368	G09.1_2113005368_6	In this paper, we discuss the frameworks of distributed agent-based real time network intrusion forensics system, which is deployed in local area network environment.
G09.1		2113005368	G09.1_2113005368_7	Some novel approaches for network forensics are discussed for the first time, such as network forensics server, network forensics database, network forensics agents, forensics data integration and active real time network forensic.
G09.1		2174029223	G09.1_2174029223_1	Information and the technological advancements for which mankind develops with regards to its storage has increased tremendously over the past few decades.
G09.1		2174029223	G09.1_2174029223_2	As the total amount of data stored rapidly increases in conjunction with the amount of widely available computer-driven devices being used, solutions are being developed to better harness this data.
G09.1		2174029223	G09.1_2174029223_3	These types of advancements are continually assisting investigators and computer forensic examiners.
G09.1		2174029223	G09.1_2174029223_4	One such application which houses copious amounts of fruitful data is the Google Desktop Search program.
G09.1		2174029223	G09.1_2174029223_5	Coupled with tested and verified techniques, examiners can exploit the power of this application to cater to their investigative needs.
G09.1		2174029223	G09.1_2174029223_6	Please find within a real world case example of these techniques and its subsequent outcome.
G09.1		1975454761	G09.1_1975454761_1	Authorship Verification is an important sub discipline of digital text forensics.
G09.1		1975454761	G09.1_1975454761_2	Its goal is to decide, if two texts are written by the same author or not.
G09.1		1975454761	G09.1_1975454761_3	We present an efficient Authorship Verification scheme based on an ensemble of K-Nearest Neighbor classifiers, where each classifier generates a decision regarding a feature category.
G09.1		1975454761	G09.1_1975454761_4	Our scheme provides many benefits such as, for instance, the independence of linguistic resources like thesauruses or language models.
G09.1		1975454761	G09.1_1975454761_5	Furthermore, it can handle different Indo-European languages as for instance English, German, Spanish, Greek, Dutch, Swedish or French.
G09.1		1975454761	G09.1_1975454761_6	Another benefit is the low runtime, due to the fact that deep linguistic processing (tagging, chunking, parsing, etc.)
G09.1		1975454761	G09.1_1975454761_7	is not taken into account.
G09.1		1975454761	G09.1_1975454761_8	Moreover, our scheme can easily be modified for example by replacing the involved distance function, the acceptance criterion or the used features including their parameters.
G09.1		1975454761	G09.1_1975454761_9	The proposed scheme is evaluated against the publicly available PAN-2013 Author Identification (AI) test corpus, where it was ranked as the second-best in the top ten list, as well as against five other test corpora, compiled by our own.
G09.1		1975454761	G09.1_1975454761_10	We show in our experiments that it is possible to achieve promising results, even when using a fixed setting of parameters and features across seven different languages.
G10.1		1994634749	G10.1_1994634749_1	In this paper, we present a system that enables humanoid robots to imitate complex whole-body motions of humans in real time.
G10.1		1994634749	G10.1_1994634749_2	In our approach, we use a compact human model and consider the positions of the endeffectors as well as the center of mass as the most important aspects to imitate.
G10.1		1994634749	G10.1_1994634749_3	Our system actively balances the center of mass over the support polygon to avoid falls of the robot, which would occur when using direct imitation.
G10.1		1994634749	G10.1_1994634749_4	For every point in time, our approach generates a statically stable pose.
G10.1		1994634749	G10.1_1994634749_5	Hereby, we do not constrain the configurations to be in double support.
G10.1		1994634749	G10.1_1994634749_6	Instead, we allow for changes of the support mode according to the motions to imitate.
G10.1		1994634749	G10.1_1994634749_7	To achieve safe imitation, we use retargeting of the robot’s feet if necessary and find statically stable configurations by inverse kinematics.
G10.1		1994634749	G10.1_1994634749_8	We present experiments using human data captured with an Xsens MVN motion capture system.
G10.1		1994634749	G10.1_1994634749_9	The results show that a Nao humanoid is able to reliably imitate complex whole-body motions in real time, which also include extended periods of time in single support mode, in which the robot has to balance on one foot.
G10.1		2907678856	G10.1_2907678856_1	In this paper, we present a novel solution to mobile robot coverage of unstructured environments.
G10.1		2907678856	G10.1_2907678856_2	We apply boustrophedon-based planning and use a heuristic to make the minimum sum of altitudes (MSA) decomposition, which computes an optimal exact cellular decomposition, applicable to more complex environments.
G10.1		2907678856	G10.1_2907678856_3	Contrary to previous approaches, our technique explicitly takes into account different entry and exit points for the obtained cells and hence allows for minimizing inter-region distances in the corresponding traveling salesman problem (TSP) formulation.
G10.1		2907678856	G10.1_2907678856_4	This is a highly important factor for unstructured environments, which heavily influences the quality of the final plan.
G10.1		2907678856	G10.1_2907678856_5	Furthermore, we show how our method is applicable to coverage with finite resources.
G10.1		2907678856	G10.1_2907678856_6	We implemented our planner in ROS and performed extensive experiments in a V-REP simulation environment in various scenarios.
G10.1		2907678856	G10.1_2907678856_7	Comparisons with a state-of-the-art boustrophedon-based method show that our approach has a significantly lower total coverage time.
G10.1		2907678856	G10.1_2907678856_8	Additionally, we demonstrate that our system is capable of performing online recharging and replanning in dynamic, crowded environments while obtaining a high coverage percentage.
G10.1		2907678856	G10.1_2907678856_9	The results of this work are relevant for a variety of real-world applications such as autonomous floor cleaning.
G10.1		2980654480	G10.1_2980654480_1	In this paper, we consider the problem of predicting the navigation goal of a moving human in an indoor environment.
G10.1		2980654480	G10.1_2980654480_2	Knowledge about this goal can greatly increase the efficiency of robots acting in the same environment as interferences can be avoided and assistance quickly provided if necessary.
G10.1		2980654480	G10.1_2980654480_3	Often the navigation goal depends on the previous action of the human and the object the human has interacted with before.
G10.1		2980654480	G10.1_2980654480_4	Thus, the information about previous object interactions can be used to infer possible objects the human will interact with next, which in term can be used to predict the current navigation goal.
G10.1		2980654480	G10.1_2980654480_5	We propose to learn a probability distribution of subsequent object interactions and present a framework that utilizes the learned transition model as well as observations of the humanu0027s location and pose for the prediction of their movement goal.
G10.1		2980654480	G10.1_2980654480_6	As we show in various experiments, the information about transition probabilities of object interactions leads to reliable predictions of the navigation goal and improves the accuracy compared to prediction approaches that rely only on spatial information and do not consider object interactions.
G10.1		2980654480	G10.1_2980654480_7	Furthermore, we demonstrate how the prediction can be used to realize foresighted robot navigation.
G10.1		2981154067	G10.1_2981154067_1	In this paper, we present a novel, efficient approach to improve the acceleration commands computed by the popular social force model (SFM) [1] for navigation through pedestrian crowds.
G10.1		2981154067	G10.1_2981154067_2	Our method consists of two stages.
G10.1		2981154067	G10.1_2981154067_3	In the first phase, we collect training data with a simulated approach.
G10.1		2981154067	G10.1_2981154067_4	In this step, we modify the steering acceleration commands from the SFM according to a set of discrete alterations and simulate the motion of the robot as well as the pedestrians into the future for each alteration.
G10.1		2981154067	G10.1_2981154067_5	We rate each resulting trajectory based on a cost function and apply the best steering command to the robot.
G10.1		2981154067	G10.1_2981154067_6	While controlling the robot in such way, we collect for every time step the input and output training data.
G10.1		2981154067	G10.1_2981154067_7	In the second stage, we then learn a neural network given the collected training data.
G10.1		2981154067	G10.1_2981154067_8	We use the best acceleration values experienced in the first phase as target values for the neural network and define simple input features describing the local surrounding of the robot.
G10.1		2981154067	G10.1_2981154067_9	In extensive simulation experiments using different pedestrian densities, we demonstrate that the controls generated by the learned neural network lead to a significantly reduced number of collisions with pedestrians compared to the results of the basic SFM controller, while achieving similar or even shorter completion times.
G10.1		2910097674	G10.1_2910097674_1	Next-best-view algorithms are commonly used for covering known scenes, for example in search, maintenance, and mapping tasks.
G10.1		2910097674	G10.1_2910097674_2	In this paper, we consider the problem of planning a strategy for covering articulated environments where the robot also has to manipulate objects to inspect obstructed areas.
G10.1		2910097674	G10.1_2910097674_3	This problem is particularly challenging due to the many degrees of freedom resulting from the articulation.
G10.1		2910097674	G10.1_2910097674_4	We propose to exploit graphics processing units present in many embedded devices to parallelize the computations of a greedy next-best-view approach.
G10.1		2910097674	G10.1_2910097674_5	We implemented algorithms for costmap computation, path planning, as well as simulation and evaluation of viewpoint candidates in OpenGL for Embedded Systems and benchmarked the implementations on multiple device classes ranging from smartphones to multi-GPU servers.
G10.1		2910097674	G10.1_2910097674_6	We introduce a heuristic for estimating a utility map from images rendered with strategically placed spherical cameras and show in simulation experiments that robots can successfully explore complex articulated scenes with our system.
G10.1		1591926975	G10.1_1591926975_1	In grasping tasks carried out with humanoids, knowledge about the robotu0027s reachable workspace is important.
G10.1		1591926975	G10.1_1591926975_2	Without this knowledge, it might be necessary to repeatedly adapt the stance location and call an inverse kinematics solver before a valid robot configuration to reach a given grasping pose can be found.
G10.1		1591926975	G10.1_1591926975_3	In this paper, we present an approach to select an optimal stance location in SE(2) for a humanoid robotu0027s feet relative to a desired grasp pose.
G10.1		1591926975	G10.1_1591926975_4	We use a precomputed representation of the robotu0027s reachable workspace that stores quality information in addition to spatial data.
G10.1		1591926975	G10.1_1591926975_5	By inverting this representation we obtain a so-called inverse reachability map (IRM) containing a collection of potential stance poses for the robot.
G10.1		1591926975	G10.1_1591926975_6	The generated IRM can subsequently be used to select a statically stable, collision-free stance configuration to reach a given grasping target.
G10.1		1591926975	G10.1_1591926975_7	We evaluated our approach with a Nao humanoid in simulation and in experiments with the real robot.
G10.1		1591926975	G10.1_1591926975_8	As the experiments show, using our approach optimal stance poses can easily be obtained.
G10.1		1591926975	G10.1_1591926975_9	Furthermore, the IRM leads to a substantially increased success rate of reaching grasping poses compared to other meaningful foot placements within the vicinity of the desired grasp.
G10.1		2967846306	G10.1_2967846306_1	Foresighted navigation is an essential skill for robots to rise from rigid factory floor installations to much more versatile mobile robots that partake in our everyday environment.
G10.1		2967846306	G10.1_2967846306_2	The current state of the art that provides this mobility to some extent is the Dynamic Window Approach combined with a global start-to-target path planner.
G10.1		2967846306	G10.1_2967846306_3	However, neither the Dynamic Window Approach nor the path planner are equipped to predict the motion of other objects in the environment.
G10.1		2967846306	G10.1_2967846306_4	We propose a change in the Dynamic Window Approach—a dynamic collision model—that is capable of predicting future collisions with the environment by also taking into account the motion of other objects.
G10.1		2967846306	G10.1_2967846306_5	We show in simulated experiments that our new way of computing the Dynamic Window Approach significantly reduces the number of collisions in a dynamic setting with nonholonomic vehicles while still being computationally efficient.
G10.1		2783763601	G10.1_2783763601_1	Covering a known 3D environment with a robotu0027s camera is a commonly required task, for example in inspection and surveillance, mapping, or object search applications.
G10.1		2783763601	G10.1_2783763601_2	In addition to the problem of finding a complete and efficient set of view points for covering the whole environment, humanoid robots also need to observe balance, energy, and kinematic constraints for reaching the desired view poses.
G10.1		2783763601	G10.1_2783763601_3	In this paper, we approach this high-dimensional planning problem by introducing a novel inverse reachability map representation that can be used for fast pose generation and combine it with a next-best-view algorithm.
G10.1		2783763601	G10.1_2783763601_4	We implemented our approach in ROS and tested it with a Nao robot on both simulated and real-world scenes.
G10.1		2783763601	G10.1_2783763601_5	The experiments show that our approach enables the humanoid to efficiently cover room-sized environments with its camera.
G10.1		2570611506	G10.1_2570611506_1	A variety of approaches exist that tackle the problem of humanoid locomotion.
G10.1		2570611506	G10.1_2570611506_2	The spectrum ranges from dynamic walking controllers that allow fast walking to systems that plan longer footstep paths through complicated scenes.
G10.1		2570611506	G10.1_2570611506_3	Simple walking controllers do not guarantee collision-free steps, whereas most existing footstep planners are not capable of providing results in real time.
G10.1		2570611506	G10.1_2570611506_4	Thus, these methods cannot be used, not even in combination, to react to sudden changes in the environment.
G10.1		2570611506	G10.1_2570611506_5	In this paper, we propose a new fast search method that combines A∗ with an adaptive 3D action set.
G10.1		2570611506	G10.1_2570611506_6	When expanding a node, we systematically search for suitable footsteps by taking into account height information.
G10.1		2570611506	G10.1_2570611506_7	As we show in various experiments, our approach outperforms standard A∗-based footstep planning in both run time and path cost and, combined with an efficient map segmentation, finds valid footstep plans in 3D environments in under 50 ms.
G10.1		2409062585	G10.1_2409062585_1	To this date, many footstep planning systems rely on external sensors for mapping and traversability analysis or on computationally expensive algorithms that do not allow for real-time calculations.
G10.1		2409062585	G10.1_2409062585_2	In this paper, we present an approach that analyzes the environment in the vicinity of the robot with an onboard RGBD camera while computing local footstep plans in real time.
G10.1		2409062585	G10.1_2409062585_3	We achieve this by combining the advantages of grid-based height maps, fast planar region segmentation, and a systematic local footstep search to a local goal point.
G10.1		2409062585	G10.1_2409062585_4	Using a single CPU core, a full mapping and planning cycle only takes 18 ms on average and thus presents an important step to autonomous humanoid robots in dynamic environments that only rely on their onboard hardware.
G10.1		2544432894	G10.1_2544432894_1	Future life pictures humans having intelligent humanoid robotic systems taking part in their everyday life.
G10.1		2544432894	G10.1_2544432894_2	Thus researchers strive to supply robots with an adequate artificial intelligence in order to achieve a natural and intuitive interaction between human being and robotic system.
G10.1		2544432894	G10.1_2544432894_3	Within the German Humanoid Project we focus on learning and cooperating multimodal robotic systems.
G10.1		2544432894	G10.1_2544432894_4	In this paper we present a first cognitive architecture for our humanoid robot: The architecture is a mixture of a hierarchical three-layered form on the one hand and a composition of behaviour-specific modules on the other hand.
G10.1		2544432894	G10.1_2544432894_5	Perception, learning, planning of actions, motor control, and human-like communication play an important role in the robotic system and are embedded step by step in our architecture
G10.1		2118055828	G10.1_2118055828_1	In this paper, we present an approach to enable a humanoid robot to autonomously climb up spiral staircases.
G10.1		2118055828	G10.1_2118055828_2	This task is substantially more challenging than climbing straight stairs since careful repositioning is needed.
G10.1		2118055828	G10.1_2118055828_3	Our system globally estimates the pose of the robot, which is subsequently refined by integrating visual observations.
G10.1		2118055828	G10.1_2118055828_4	In this way, the robot can accurately determine its relative position with respect to the next step.
G10.1		2118055828	G10.1_2118055828_5	We use a 3D model of the environment to project edges corresponding to stair contours into monocular camera images.
G10.1		2118055828	G10.1_2118055828_6	By detecting edges in the images and associating them to projected model edges, the robot is able to accurately locate itself towards the stairs and to climb them.
G10.1		2118055828	G10.1_2118055828_7	We present experiments carried out with a Nao humanoid equipped with a 2D laser range finder for global localization and a low-cost monocular camera for short-range sensing.
G10.1		2118055828	G10.1_2118055828_8	As we show in the experiments, the robot reliably climbs up the steps of a spiral staircase.
G10.1		2108507649	G10.1_2108507649_1	Humanoid robots possess the capability of stepping over or onto objects, which distinguishes them from wheeled robots.
G10.1		2108507649	G10.1_2108507649_2	When planning paths for humanoids, one therefore should consider an intelligent placement of footsteps instead of choosing detours around obstacles.
G10.1		2108507649	G10.1_2108507649_3	In this paper, we present an approach to optimal footstep planning for humanoid robots.
G10.1		2108507649	G10.1_2108507649_4	Since changes in the environment may appear and a humanoid may deviate from its originally planned path due to imprecise motion execution or slippage on the ground, the robot might be forced to dynamically revise its plans.
G10.1		2108507649	G10.1_2108507649_5	Thus, efficient methods for planning and replanning are needed to quickly adapt the footstep paths to new situations.
G10.1		2108507649	G10.1_2108507649_6	We formulate the problem of footstep planning so that it can be solved with the incremental heuristic search method D* Lite and present our extensions, including continuous footstep locations and efficient collision checking for footsteps.
G10.1		2108507649	G10.1_2108507649_7	In experiments in simulation and with a real Nao humanoid, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the footstep plans computed and revised by our method.
G10.1		2108507649	G10.1_2108507649_8	Additionally, we evaluate different footstep sets and heuristics to identify the ones leading to the best performance in terms of path quality and planning time.
G10.1		2108507649	G10.1_2108507649_9	Our D* Lite algorithm for footstep planning is available as open source implementation.
G10.1		1520172171	G10.1_1520172171_1	This paper presents the assessment methodology to investigate relationship between Intelligence Quotient (IQ) of children with autism and their respective initial response during robotic intervention, compared to normal classroom interaction.
G10.1		1520172171	G10.1_1520172171_2	Autism is a brain developmental disorder that leads to the irregular behavior in three common aspects; repetitive stereotyped behavior, communication difficulties, and social interaction.
G10.1		1520172171	G10.1_1520172171_3	This research introduced robot in humanoid form as assistive tool in child-robot intervention program to investigate the relationship between IQ levels with response of the children in the robot interaction sessions.
G10.1		1520172171	G10.1_1520172171_4	The Robot-Based Intervention Program (RBIP) is introduced to facilitate the experimental process.
G10.1		1520172171	G10.1_1520172171_5	The autistic children interact with the robot and completing the interaction modules that has been designed and developed for them which is aimed to reduce the present of autism characteristic and behavior.
G10.1		2052011296	G10.1_2052011296_1	In this paper, we consider the problem of efficient path planning for humanoid robots by combining grid-based 2D planning with footstep planning.
G10.1		2052011296	G10.1_2052011296_2	In this way, we exploit the advantages of both frameworks, namely fast planning on grids and the ability to find solutions in situations where grid-based planning fails.
G10.1		2052011296	G10.1_2052011296_3	Our method computes a global solution by adaptively switching between fast grid-based planning in open spaces and footstep planning in the vicinity of obstacles.
G10.1		2052011296	G10.1_2052011296_4	To decide which planning framework to use, our approach classifies the environment into regions of different complexity with respect to the traversability.
G10.1		2052011296	G10.1_2052011296_5	Experiments carried out in a simulated office environment and with a Nao humanoid show that (i) our approach significantly reduces the planning time compared to pure footstep planning and (ii) the resulting plans are almost as good as globally computed optimal footstep paths.
G10.2	disrupting	2770089821	G10.2_2770089821_1	We present the MASSE architecture, a YARA-based open source client-server malware detection platform.
G10.2	disrupting	2770089821	G10.2_2770089821_2	MASSE includes highly effective automated syntactic malware detection rule generation for the clients based on a server-side modular malware detection system.
G10.2	disrupting	2770089821	G10.2_2770089821_3	Multiple techniques are used to make MASSE effective at detecting malware while keeping it from disrupting users and hindering reverse-engineering of its malware analysis by malware creators.
G10.2	disrupting	2739472079	G10.2_2739472079_1	Water, a valuable resource, is usually distributed through urban environments by buried pipes.
G10.2	disrupting	2739472079	G10.2_2739472079_2	These pipes are difficult to access for inspection, maintenance and repair.
G10.2	disrupting	2739472079	G10.2_2739472079_3	This makes in-pipe robots an appealing technology for inspecting water pipes and localising damage prior to repair from above ground.
G10.2	disrupting	2739472079	G10.2_2739472079_4	Accurate localisation of damage is of critical importance because of the costs associated with excavating roads, disrupting traffic and disrupting the water supply.
G10.2	disrupting	2739472079	G10.2_2739472079_5	The problem is that pipes tend to be relatively featureless making robot localisation a challenging problem.
G10.2	disrupting	2739472079	G10.2_2739472079_6	In this paper we propose a novel simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) algorithm for metal water pipes.
G10.2	disrupting	2739472079	G10.2_2739472079_7	The approach we take is to excite pipe vibration with a hydrophone (sound induced vibration), which leads to a map of pipe vibration amplitude over space.
G10.2	disrupting	2739472079	G10.2_2739472079_8	We then develop a SLAM algorithm that makes use of this new type of map, where the estimation method is based on the Rao-Blackwellised particle filter (RBPF), termed PipeSLAM.
G10.2	disrupting	2739472079	G10.2_2739472079_9	The approach is also suited to SLAM in plastic water pipes using a similar type of map derived from ultrasonic sensing.
G10.2	disrupting	2739472079	G10.2_2739472079_10	We successfully demonstrate the feasibility of the approach using a combination of experimental and simulation data.
G11.1	drones	2613890548	G11.1_2613890548_1	Deploying drones over the Cloud is an emerging research area motivated by the emergence of Cloud Robotics and the Internet-of-Drones (IoD) paradigms.
G11.1	drones	2613890548	G11.1_2613890548_2	This paper contributes to IoD and to the deployment of drones over the cloud.
G11.1	drones	2613890548	G11.1_2613890548_3	It presents, Dronemap Planner, an innovative service-oriented cloud based drone management system that provides access to drones through web services (SOAP and REST), schedule missions and promotes collaboration between drones.
G11.1	drones	2613890548	G11.1_2613890548_4	A modular cloud proxy server was developed; it acts as a moderator between drones and users.
G11.1	drones	2613890548	G11.1_2613890548_5	Communication between drones, users and the Dronemap Planner cloud is provided through the MAVLink protocol, which is supported by commodity drones.
G11.1	drones	2613890548	G11.1_2613890548_6	To demonstrate the effectiveness of Dronemap Planner, we implemented and validated it using simulated and real MAVLink-enabled drones, and deployed it on a public cloud server.
G11.1	drones	2613890548	G11.1_2613890548_7	Experimental results show that Dronemap Planner is efficient in virtualizing the access to drones over the Internet, and provides developers with appropriate APIs to easily program dronesu0027 applications.
G11.1	drones	2478053673	G11.1_2478053673_1	In recent years, due to the technological development of various kinds of drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), drones have emerged as an effective solution for a wide area of applications.
G11.1	drones	2478053673	G11.1_2478053673_2	In such applications, employing multiple drones promises a better way to carry out a given mission than employing a single drone.
G11.1	drones	2478053673	G11.1_2478053673_3	To utilize multiple drones, all drones should establish a network that can provide connectivity among themselves.
G11.1	drones	2478053673	G11.1_2478053673_4	In this paper, we propose GCS-routing, a routing protocol for multiple drones employed by a ground control system (GCS).
G11.1	drones	2478053673	G11.1_2478053673_5	GCS-routing utilizes the information of drones that can be obtained from GCS, such as geographic information and per-drone flight schedules.
G11.1	drones	2478053673	G11.1_2478053673_6	The actual implementation of GCS-routing was applied to a fleet of drones, and evaluated in various aspects.
G11.1	drones	2596773120	G11.1_2596773120_1	We present a tutorial introduction to the multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles, often simply referred as drones.
G11.1	drones	2596773120	G11.1_2596773120_2	We first explain typical configuration, components and construction of the drones.
G11.1	drones	2596773120	G11.1_2596773120_3	We then provide basic kinematic and dynamic modeling of drones and their principle of flight.
G11.1	drones	2596773120	G11.1_2596773120_4	Some representative motion control techniques are then presented, which take into account the issue of under-actuation of the drones.
G11.1	drones	2596773120	G11.1_2596773120_5	State estimation problem of the drones, that is crucial for their proper flying, yet, should be done only by using onboard sensors and their sensor fusion, is explained.
G11.1	drones	2596773120	G11.1_2596773120_6	Some emerging research directions requiring capability beyond typical drones are also mentioned.
G11.1	drones	2802259057	G11.1_2802259057_1	Carrying capabilities of drones and their easy accessibility to public have led to an increase in crimes committed using drones in recent years.
G11.1	drones	2802259057	G11.1_2802259057_2	For this reason, the need for forensic analysis of drones captured from the crime scenes and the devices used for these drones is also paramount.
G11.1	drones	2802259057	G11.1_2802259057_3	This paper presents the extraction and identification of important artefacts from the recorded flight data as well as the associated mobile devices using open source tools and some basic scripts developed to aid the analysis of two popular drone systems- the DJI Phantom 3 Professional and Parrot AR.
G11.1	drones	2802259057	G11.1_2802259057_4	Drone 2.0.
G11.1	drones	2802259057	G11.1_2802259057_5	Although different drones vary in their operations, this paper extends the extraction and analysis of the data from the drones and associated devices using some generic methods which are forensically sound adhering to the guidelines of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO).
G11.1	drones	2896571420	G11.1_2896571420_1	In recent years, it has become possible for anyone to purchase high-performance Drones at low price.
G11.1	drones	2896571420	G11.1_2896571420_2	The Drones are equipped with a unit of high-vision camera, multiple compact cameras for flight control, gyroscope, infrared sensor, GPS, and a processor for processing video images and sensor information for controlling the flight.
G11.1	drones	2896571420	G11.1_2896571420_3	Relatively stable flight is available for Drones by operating within human’s sight.
G11.1	drones	2896571420	G11.1_2896571420_4	In this paper, we introduced our collaborative security flight control system for multiple drones.
G11.1	drones	2896571420	G11.1_2896571420_5	We considered the case of weak wind.
G11.1	drones	2896571420	G11.1_2896571420_6	To deal with weak wind, we propose that the drones change the formation.
G11.1	drones	2896571420	G11.1_2896571420_7	We added the Caution level for the safety level.
G11.1	drones	2896571420	G11.1_2896571420_8	In the case of weak wind, the Caution level is activated and the drones change the position (formation) in order to keep the distance between them.
G11.1	drones	2908934275	G11.1_2908934275_1	As the number of commercial Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones continues to increase, there is a need to develop autonomous policing or patrolling mechanism to guard over the swarm of anonymous intruding drones having unknown heterogeneous dynamical behavior and maintain the safety and order in the sky.
G11.1	drones	2908934275	G11.1_2908934275_2	This paper addresses such a future need and proposes to employ a swarm of patrolling drones that can collectively search a flying zone to find and follow the other anonymous drones effectively for any relevant purposes.
G11.1	drones	2908934275	G11.1_2908934275_3	Specifically, the key contribution of this research is the development of a robust and flexible search mechanism, which enables the patrolling drones to overcome confusing evasive tactics by the anonymous drones.
G11.1	drones	2908934275	G11.1_2908934275_4	During the search process, the patrolling drones first scatter to cover a region of interest, and then proceed to find and follow an anonymous drone.
G11.1	drones	2908934275	G11.1_2908934275_5	For this purpose, a multi-objective optimization problem is formulated.
G11.1	drones	2908934275	G11.1_2908934275_6	The problem is solved using a few evolutionary algorithms, and performances/results are evaluated through simulation.
G11.1	drones	2908934275	G11.1_2908934275_7	It is found that multiple particle swarm optimization (MPSO) requires the least processing time.
G11.1	drones	2968221061	G11.1_2968221061_1	This Paper will explore the vulnerabilities that military and IoT commercial drones are exposed to in the wild and controlled environment.
G11.1	drones	2968221061	G11.1_2968221061_2	Drones have been used in military campaigns and this has seeped over to the commercial environment.
G11.1	drones	2968221061	G11.1_2968221061_3	Hobbyist are using commercial drones in higher percentages.
G11.1	drones	2968221061	G11.1_2968221061_4	Both military and commercial drones have vulnerabilities and are being attacked by attackers.
G11.1	drones	2968221061	G11.1_2968221061_5	These attackers are controlling drones or denying services to disable users from normal operations.
G11.1	drones	2968221061	G11.1_2968221061_6	These are attacks that target Confidentiality, integrity, availability (CIA) in some form or another.
G11.1	drones	2968221061	G11.1_2968221061_7	Attacks on CIA, military or commercial, are prevalent and will continue to happen due to how drones communicate.
G11.1	drones	2968221061	G11.1_2968221061_8	Almost, all the vulnerabilities and exploits can be mitigated using the resources on the drone.
G11.1	drones	2968221061	G11.1_2968221061_9	An attack that cannot be protected against is a Zero-day attack however, we are able to mitigate it.
G11.1	drones	2968221061	G11.1_2968221061_10	This document explore the dangers present by some UAV’s on the market and the exploitable aspects that these users may be prone to as well as how this may affect the drone operations for both military and commercial drones or what information can be gathered by the attacker while taking advantage of the exploits on the IoT device.
G11.1	drones	3001378154	G11.1_3001378154_1	Previous research has established that drones could be an efficient tool for farming.
G11.1	drones	3001378154	G11.1_3001378154_2	In this paper, we study the problem of livestock tracking and monitoring using a group of drones.
G11.1	drones	3001378154	G11.1_3001378154_3	The main objective is to deploy a limited number of drones to track and monitor the maximum number of livestock, such as cattle and sheep, in a vast pasture while minimizing the average drone-animal distance.
G11.1	drones	3001378154	G11.1_3001378154_4	We assume the targeted livestock have been fitted with GPS collars, and the mobility of each animal cannot be neglected.
G11.1	drones	3001378154	G11.1_3001378154_5	We first introduce a procedure of performing sweep coverage by drones.
G11.1	drones	3001378154	G11.1_3001378154_6	By deploying drones to accomplish sweep coverage for the entire pasture, the initial locations of all targeted animals can be acquired.
G11.1	drones	3001378154	G11.1_3001378154_7	Then we applied a density-based clustering algorithm DBSCAN to find the deployment that places the drones to the centroids of animal clusters.
G11.1	drones	3001378154	G11.1_3001378154_8	Furthermore, based on the updated animalsu0027 locations, the deployment of the drones can be updated to follow the movement of animal clusters.
G11.1	drones	3001378154	G11.1_3001378154_9	We demonstrate that our solution can always yield a lower average drone-animal distance and a higher number of covered targeted animals, compared with the standard K-Means clustering algorithm.
G11.1	drones	2766224648	G11.1_2766224648_1	The use of amateur drones is expected to significantly increase over the upcoming years.
G11.1	drones	2766224648	G11.1_2766224648_2	However, regulations do not allow such drones to fly over all areas, in addition to typical altitude limitations.
G11.1	drones	2766224648	G11.1_2766224648_3	As a result, there is an urgent need for amateur drone surveillance solutions.
G11.1	drones	2766224648	G11.1_2766224648_4	These solutions should include means of accurate detection, classification, and localization of the unwanted drones in a no-fly zone.
G11.1	drones	2766224648	G11.1_2766224648_5	In this article, we give an overview of promising techniques for modulation classification and signal-strength-based localization of amateur drones by using surveillance drones.
G11.1	drones	2766224648	G11.1_2766224648_6	By introducing a generic altitude-dependent propagation model, we show how detection and localization performance depend on the altitude of surveillance drones.
G11.1	drones	2766224648	G11.1_2766224648_7	Particularly, our simulation results show a 25 dB reduction in the minimum detectable power or 10 times coverage enhancement of a surveillance drone by flying at the optimum altitude.
G11.1	drones	2766224648	G11.1_2766224648_8	Moreover, for a target no-fly zone, the location estimation error of an amateur drone can be remarkably reduced by optimizing the positions of the surveillance drones.
G11.1	drones	2766224648	G11.1_2766224648_9	Finally, we conclude the article with a general discussion about the future work and possible challenges in aerial surveillance systems.
G11.1	drones	2947305876	G11.1_2947305876_1	In this paper, we simulated a distributed, cooperative path planning technique for multiple drones ($\sim$200) to explore an unknown region ($\sim$10,000 connected units) in the presence of obstacles.
G11.1	drones	2947305876	G11.1_2947305876_2	The map of an unknown region is dynamically created based on the information obtained from sensors and other drones.
G11.1	drones	2947305876	G11.1_2947305876_3	The unknown area is considered as connected region made up of hexagonal unit cells.
G11.1	drones	2947305876	G11.1_2947305876_4	These cells are grouped to form larger cells called sub-areas.
G11.1	drones	2947305876	G11.1_2947305876_5	We use two types of communication, one long range and another more frequently used short range communication.
G11.1	drones	2947305876	G11.1_2947305876_6	The short range communication within drones in smaller proximity helps avoid obstacles and re-exploration of cells already explored by companion drones located in same subarea.
G11.1	drones	2947305876	G11.1_2947305876_7	The long range communication helps drones identify next sub area to be targeted by individual drones based on weighted RNN (Reverse nearest neighbour).\par Simulation results show that using weighted RNN with two types of communication in a hexagonal representation of subareas makes exploration more efficient, scalable and resilient to communication failures.
G11.1	drones	2900570814	G11.1_2900570814_1	In recent years drones have become more widely used in military and non-military applications.
G11.1	drones	2900570814	G11.1_2900570814_2	Automation of these drones will become more important as their use increases.
G11.1	drones	2900570814	G11.1_2900570814_3	Individual drones acting autonomously will be able to achieve some tasks, but swarms of autonomous drones working together will be able to achieve much more complex tasks and be able to better adapt to changing environments.
G11.1	drones	2900570814	G11.1_2900570814_4	In this paper we describe an example scenario involving a swarm of drones from a military coalition and civil/humanitarian organisations that are working collaboratively to monitor areas at risk of flooding.
G11.1	drones	2900570814	G11.1_2900570814_5	We provide a definition of a swarm and how they can operate by exchanging messages.
G11.1	drones	2900570814	G11.1_2900570814_6	We define a flexible set of policies that are applicable to our scenario that can be easily extended to other scenarios or policy paradigms.
G11.1	drones	2900570814	G11.1_2900570814_7	These policies ensure that the swarms of drones behave as expected (e.g., for safety and security).
G11.1	drones	2900570814	G11.1_2900570814_8	Finally we discuss the challenges and limitations around policies for autonomous swarms and how new research, such as generative policies, can aid in solving these limitations.

G12.1	patient data	2060122984	G12.1_2060122984_3	In this paper, it has been demonstrated that processing the patient data with a fuzzy-genetic algorithm at expert doctor end will reduce the uncertainties and vagueness in the patient data.
G12.1	patient data	2060122984	G12.1_2060122984_4	The initial population for the genetic algorithm is randomly generated with assumed fuzzy functions.
G12.1	patient data	2060122984	G12.1_2060122984_5	These functions are optimized using the theory of reproduction, crossover, and mutation.
G12.1	patient data	2060122984	G12.1_2060122984_6	The result shows that the fuzzy-genetic algorithm give satisfactory result for telemedicine.)
G12.1	patient data	2761214154	G12.1_2761214154_1	In the medicine practice, due to the privacy and safety of electronic medical record (EMR), the sharing, research and application of EMR have been hindered to a certain extent.
G12.1	patient data	2761214154	G12.1_2761214154_2	Thus, it becomes increasingly important to study semantic electronic medical data integration, so as to meet the needs of doctors and researchers and help them quickly access high-quality information.
G12.1	patient data	2761214154	G12.1_2761214154_3	This paper focuses on the realization of semantic EMRs.
G12.1	patient data	2761214154	G12.1_2761214154_4	It shows how to uses APDG (Advanced Patient Data Generator) to create a set of virtual patient data for depression.
G12.1	patient data	2761214154	G12.1_2761214154_5	Furthermore, it explains how to develop clinical and semantic description rules to construct semantic EMRs for depression and discusses how those generated virtual patient data can be used in the system of Smart Ward for the test and demonstration, without violating the legal issues (e.g., privacy and security) of patient data.
G12.1	patient data	2765117222	G12.1_2765117222_1	Paper based medical records face many challenges such as inability of real-time access to patient data, exchange and share medical data, and monitor a patients’ health progress.
G12.1	patient data	2765117222	G12.1_2765117222_2	This negatively affects the ability to improve a patients’ health and carry out medical research.
G12.1	patient data	2765117222	G12.1_2765117222_3	Adopting electronic medical records (EMR) may help address some issues faced with paper records.
G12.1	patient data	2765117222	G12.1_2765117222_4	However, standalone EMR systems may not fully mitigate some issues with paper records due to lack of real-time access to patient data.
G12.1	patient data	2765117222	G12.1_2765117222_5	Cloud Computing presents cost-effective ways of integrating EMR systems together for different health institutions to share selected patient data.
G12.1	patient data	2765117222	G12.1_2765117222_6	However, the extent to which South African health facilities are ready to adopt cloud based EMR, and the nature of patient data that can be shared on the cloud remains unclear.
G12.1	patient data	2765117222	G12.1_2765117222_7	This study investigates the viability of a cloud based EMR for health institutions in the Free State province of South Africa.

G12.1	patient data	2883672015	G12.1_2883672015_1	Analyzing patients’ health data using machine learning techniques can improve both patient outcomes and hospital operations.
G12.1	patient data	2883672015	G12.1_2883672015_2	However, heterogeneous patient data (e.g., vital signs) and inefficient feature learning methods affect the implementation of machine learning-based patient data analysis.
G12.1	patient data	2883672015	G12.1_2883672015_3	In this paper, we present a novel unsupervised deep learning-based feature learning (DFL) framework to automatically learn compact representations from patient health data for efficient clinical decision making.
G12.1	patient data	2883672015	G12.1_2883672015_4	Real-world pneumonia patient data from the National University Hospital in Singapore are collected and analyzed to evaluate the performance of DFL.
G12.1	patient data	2883672015	G12.1_2883672015_5	Furthermore, publicly available electroencephalogram data are extracted from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to test and support our findings.

G12.1	patient data	2136971596	G12.1_2136971596_1	Patient clinical data are distributed and often fragmented in heterogeneous systems, and therefore the need for information integration is a key to reliable patient care.
G12.1	patient data	2136971596	G12.1_2136971596_2	Once the patient data are orderly integrated and readily available, the problems in accessing the distributed patient clinical data, the well-known difficulties of adopting a mobile health information system, are resolved.
G12.1	patient data	2136971596	G12.1_2136971596_3	This paper proposes a mobile clinical information system (MobileMed), which integrates the distributed and fragmented patient data across heterogeneous sources and makes them accessible through mobile devices.
G12.1	patient data	2136971596	G12.1_2136971596_4	The system consists of four main components: a smart interface, an HL7 message server (HMS), a central clinical database (CCDB), and a web server.
G12.1	patient data	2136971596	G12.1_2136971596_5	The smart interface and the HMS work in concert to generate HL7 messages from the existing legacy systems, which essentially send the patient data in HL7 messages to the CCDB to be stored and maintained.
G12.1	patient data	2136971596	G12.1_2136971596_6	The CCDB and the web server enable the physicians to access the integrated up-to-date patient data.
G12.1	patient data	2136971596	G12.1_2136971596_7	By proposing the smart interface approach, we provide a means for effortless implementation and deployment of such systems.
G12.1	patient data	2136971596	G12.1_2136971596_8	Through a performance study, we show that the HMS is reliable yet fast enough to be able to support efficient clinical data communication
G12.1	patient data	2979637109	G12.1_2979637109_1	Due to medical data privacy regulations, it is often infeasible to collect and share patient data in a centralised data lake.
G12.1	patient data	2979637109	G12.1_2979637109_2	This poses challenges for training machine learning algorithms, such as deep convolutional networks, which often require large numbers of diverse training examples.
G12.1	patient data	2979637109	G12.1_2979637109_3	Federated learning sidesteps this difficulty by bringing code to the patient data owners and only sharing intermediate model training updates among them.
G12.1	patient data	2979637109	G12.1_2979637109_4	Although a high-accuracy model could be achieved by appropriately aggregating these model updates, the model shared could indirectly leak the local training examples.

G12.1	patient data	11295093	G12.1_11295093_1	We study the effect of hospital market concentration on the quality of patient data protection practices.
G12.1	patient data	11295093	G12.1_11295093_2	We use approximately 200 reported data breaches in US hospitals over the period 2006 - 2011 as a measure of the quality of patient data protection practices.
G12.1	patient data	11295093	G12.1_11295093_3	We measure market concentration using Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) and estimate our models by exploiting cross-sectional HHI variation.
G12.1	patient data	11295093	G12.1_11295093_4	Surprisingly, we find that increased competition is associated with a decline in the quality of patient data protection.
G12.1	patient data	11295093	G12.1_11295093_5	Our main result indicates that a 100 point increase in HHI is associated with a 5% decline in the average count of data breach incidents.
G12.1	patient data	11295093	G12.1_11295093_6	The results are directionally robust to a number of alternate model specifications.
G12.1	patient data	11295093	G12.1_11295093_7	To explain our findings, we posit that hospitals in more competitive markets may be inclined to shift resources to more consumer visible activities from the less consumer visible activity of data protection.

G12.1	patient data	1076192152	G12.1_1076192152_8	The ability to extract the patient data is measured by the Bit Error Rate.
G12.1	patient data	1076192152	G12.1_1076192152_9	Performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated on the MIT-BIH database and the results validate that coefficients around zero are ideal for watermarking to minimize deterioration and there is no loss in the data retrieved.
G12.1	patient data	1076192152	G12.1_1076192152_10	For an increased patient data size, the cover signal deteriorates but the Bit Error Rate is zero.
G12.1	patient data	1076192152	G12.1_1076192152_11	Therefore the proposed approach does not affect diagnosability and allows reliable steganography.
G12.1	patient data	2121535052	G12.1_2121535052_1	In intensive care units much data is irregularly recorded.
G12.1	patient data	2121535052	G12.1_2121535052_2	Here, we consider the analysis of symbolic septic shock patient data.
G12.1	patient data	2121535052	G12.1_2121535052_3	We show that it could be worth considering the generalization paradigm (individual cases generalized to more general rules) instead of the association paradigm (combining single attributes) when considering very individual cases (e.g.
G12.1	patient data	2121535052	G12.1_2121535052_4	patients) and when expecting longer rules than shorter ones.
G12.1	patient data	2121535052	G12.1_2121535052_5	We present an algorithm for rule generation and classification based on heuristically generated set-based intersections.
G12.1	patient data	2121535052	G12.1_2121535052_6	We demonstrate the usefulness of our algorithm by analysing our septic shock patient data.
G12.1	patient data	2527811215	G12.1_2527811215_1	Abstract   Purpose  To explore the impacts that structuring of electronic health records (EHRs) has had from the perspective of secondary use of patient data as reflected in currently published literature.
G12.1	patient data	2527811215	G12.1_2527811215_2	This paper presents the results of a systematic literature review aimed at answering the following questions; (1) what are the common methods of structuring patient data to serve secondary use purposes; (2) what are the common methods of evaluating patient data structuring in the secondary use context, and (3) what impacts or outcomes of EHR structuring have been reported from the secondary use perspective.
G12.1	patient data	2527811215	G12.1_2527811215_3	Methods  The reported study forms part of a wider systematic literature review on the impacts of EHR structuring methods and evaluations of their impact.
G12.1	patient data	2527811215	G12.1_2527811215_4	The review was based on a 12-step systematic review protocol adapted from the Cochrane methodology.
G12.1	patient data	2527811215	G12.1_2527811215_5	Original articles included in the study were divided into three groups for analysis and reporting based on their use focus: nursing documentation, medical use and secondary use (presented in this paper).
G12.1	patient data	2527811215	G12.1_2527811215_6	The analysis from the perspective of secondary use of data includes 85 original articles from 1975 to 2010 retrieved from 15 bibliographic databases.
G12.1	patient data	2527811215	G12.1_2527811215_7	Results  The implementation of structured EHRs can be roughly divided into applications for documenting patient data at the point of care and application for retrieval of patient data (post hoc structuring).
G12.1	patient data	2527811215	G12.1_2527811215_8	Two thirds of the secondary use articles concern EHR structuring methods which were still under development or in the testing phase.
G12.1	patient data	2527811215	G12.1_2527811215_9	Methods  of structuring patient data such as codes, terminologies, reference information models, forms or templates and documentation standards were usually applied in combination.
G12.1	patient data	2527811215	G12.1_2527811215_10	Most of the identified benefits of utilizing structured EHR data for secondary use purposes concentrated on information content and quality or on technical quality and reliability, particularly in the case of Natural Language Processing (NLP) studies.
G12.1	patient data	2527811215	G12.1_2527811215_11	A few individual articles evaluated impacts on care processes, productivity and costs, patient safety, care quality or other health impacts.
G12.1	patient data	2527811215	G12.1_2527811215_12	In most articles these endpoints were usually discussed as goals of secondary use and less as evidence-supported impacts, resulting from the use of structured EHR data for secondary purposes.
G12.1	patient data	2527811215	G12.1_2527811215_13	Conclusions  Further studies and more sound evaluation methods are needed for evidence on how EHRs are utilized for secondary purposes, and how structured documentation methods can serve different users’ needs, e.g.
G12.1	patient data	2527811215	G12.1_2527811215_14	administration, statistics and research and development, in parallel to medical use purposes.
G12.1		1734497321	G12.1_1734497321_1	The development and investigation of medical applications require patient data from various Electronic Health Records (EHR) or Clinical Records (CR).
G12.1		1734497321	G12.1_1734497321_2	However, in practice, patient data is and should be protected and monitored to avoid unauthorized access or publicity, because of many reasons including privacy, security, ethics, and confidentiality.
G12.1		1734497321	G12.1_1734497321_3	Thus, many researchers and developers encounter the problem to access required patient data for their research or make patient data available for example to demonstrate the reproducibility of their results.
G12.1		1734497321	G12.1_1734497321_4	In this paper, we propose a knowledge-based approach of synthesizing large scale patient data.
G12.1		1734497321	G12.1_1734497321_5	Our main goal is to make the generated patient data as realistic as possible, by using domain knowledge to control the data generation process.
G12.1		1734497321	G12.1_1734497321_6	Such domain knowledge can be collected from biomedical publications such as PubMed, from medical textbooks, or web resources (e.g.
G12.1		1734497321	G12.1_1734497321_7	Wikipedia and medical websites).
G12.1		1734497321	G12.1_1734497321_8	Collected knowledge is formalized in the Patient Data Definition Language (PDDL) for the patient data generation.
G12.1		1734497321	G12.1_1734497321_9	We have implemented the proposed approach in our Advanced Patient Data Generator (APDG).
G12.1		1734497321	G12.1_1734497321_10	We have used APDG to generate large scale data for breast cancer patients in the experiments of SemanticCT, a semantically-enabled system for clinical trials.
G12.1		1734497321	G12.1_1734497321_11	The results show that the generated patient data are useful for various tests in the system.

G15.1	snowden	2326277998	G15.1_2326277998_2	In this paper we present an analysis of how the affair was discussed in the English language blogosphere, based on a corpus of 15,000 blog posts written about Snowden and published from June 2013 to June 2014, as a sub-corpus of a larger corpus of 100,000 blog posts on the topic of surveillance, written during the period 2006---2014.
G15.1	snowden	2326277998	G15.1_2326277998_3	Automated tools are used to identify the topics that characterize the blogging about surveillance and the posts about the Snowden affair.
G15.1	snowden	2326277998	G15.1_2326277998_4	Through an in-depth analysis of the blog posts that commented on Snowdenu0027s revelations of the PRISM program for surveillance of social media users, we chart how bloggers responded to Snowden and his role in this disclosure, whether they found the information credible, and the extent to which they expressed criticism of the surveillance practices.
G15.1	snowden	2326277998	G15.1_2326277998_5	The analysis is used as a basis for discussing the role of blogs in the civic engagement during the first phase of the Snowden affair.
G15.1	snowden	1970336285	G15.1_1970336285_1	In June 2013, Edward Snowden burst onto the world media scene.
G15.1	snowden	1970336285	G15.1_1970336285_2	He had worked as a contractor for the National Security Agency and collected a vast quantity of top-secret documents.
G15.1	snowden	1970336285	G15.1_1970336285_3	Snowden leaked the documents to the Guardian, a well-known British newspaper and media group, revealing that the NSA had been secretly carrying out extensive spying on electronic communications.
G15.1	snowden	1970336285	G15.1_1970336285_4	Snowden quickly became one of the worldu0027s best known whistleblowers.
G15.1	snowden	1970336285	G15.1_1970336285_5	As well as extensive commentary in the mass and social media, several major books have been published about him and his revelations.
G15.1	snowden	2550436106	G15.1_2550436106_1	Motivated by the revelations of Edward Snowden, post-Snowden cryptography has become a prominent research direction in recent years.
G15.1	snowden	2550436106	G15.1_2550436106_2	In Eurocrypt 2015, Mironov and Stephens-Davidowitz proposed a novel concept named cryptographic reverse firewall (\(\mathsf {CRF}\)) which can resist exfiltration of secret information from an arbitrarily compromised machine.
G15.1	snowden	2550436106	G15.1_2550436106_3	In this work, we continue this line of research and present generic \(\mathsf {CRF}\) constructions for several widely used cryptographic protocols based on a new notion named malleable smooth projective hash function.
G15.1	snowden	2550436106	G15.1_2550436106_4	Our contributions can be summarized as follows.

G15.1	snowden	209519132	G15.1_209519132_2	Juni 2013 ging es los: Die britische Zeitung „The Guardian“ begann mit der Veroffentlichung von Informationen zur Abhorpraxis der National Security Agency (NSA) und anderen Geheimdiensten, die aus dem Datenbestand des Whistleblowers Edward Snowden stammten.
G15.1	snowden	209519132	G15.1_209519132_3	In der folgenden Zeitperiode — dem „Summer of Snowden“ — gab es zunachst fast taglich Berichte uber weitere Facetten der Enthullungsaffare.
G15.1	snowden	209519132	G15.1_209519132_4	Spater wurden die Veroffentlichungen weniger, aber sie zogen sich weiter durch den Herbst und Winter in das nachste Jahr.
G15.1	snowden	209519132	G15.1_209519132_5	Was bedeuten diese Enthullungen fur den Datenschutz?

G15.1	snowden	2508141465	G15.1_2508141465_2	In this paper we look at Twitter and IETF mailing lists to answer questions on IETF participation and social media usage and IETF reaction to societal events: Are Internet Standards discussed on Twitter?
G15.1	snowden	2508141465	G15.1_2508141465_3	Who is involved in the process?
G15.1	snowden	2508141465	G15.1_2508141465_4	Do external events like Snowden revelations in 2013 correlate with related IETF activities?
G15.1	snowden	2508141465	G15.1_2508141465_5	To answer this, we look in particular at security-related activities at the IETF like in the TLS working group.
G15.1	snowden	2508141465	G15.1_2508141465_6	With respect to the Snowden leaks, we quantify the impact in terms of increase in activity and contributors in related areas.

G15.1	snowden	2394762924	G15.1_2394762924_1	We present a study of 10-month Twitter discussions on the controversial topic of Edward Snowden.
G15.1	snowden	2394762924	G15.1_2394762924_2	We demonstrate how behavioral differences of opinion groups can distort the presence of opinions on a social media platform.
G15.1	snowden	2394762924	G15.1_2394762924_3	"By studying the differences between a numerical minority (anti-Snowden) and a majority (pro-Snowden) group, we found that the minority group engaged in a ""shared audiencing"" practice with more persistent production of original tweets, focusing increasingly on inter-personal interactions with like-minded others."
G15.1	snowden	2394762924	G15.1_2394762924_4	"The majority group engaged in a ""gatewatching"" practice by disseminating information from the group, and over time shifted further from making original comments to retweeting othersu0027."
G15.1	snowden	2394762924	G15.1_2394762924_5	The findings show consistency with previous social science research on how social environment shapes majority and minority group behaviors.
G15.1	snowden	2394762924	G15.1_2394762924_6	"We also highlight that they can be further distorted by the collective use of social media design features such as the ""retweet"" button, by introducing the concept of ""amplificationu0027"" to measure how a design feature biases the voice of an opinion group."
G15.1	snowden	2394762924	G15.1_2394762924_7	Our work presents a warning to not oversimplify analysis of social media data for inferring social opinions.
G15.1	snowden	2560838321	G15.1_2560838321_1	Snowden is a reversal point for IT security and risk.
G15.1	snowden	2560838321	G15.1_2560838321_2	Before him, many saw IT security as equivalent to a medieval town wall: keeping outside hackers and malicious code away from the company.
G15.1	snowden	2560838321	G15.1_2560838321_3	Firewalls, virus scanners, and application security testing (e.g., to find SQL injections) fit the town wall approach.
G15.1	snowden	2560838321	G15.1_2560838321_4	But Snowden was different.
G15.1	snowden	2560838321	G15.1_2560838321_5	He was from the inside of the organization.
G15.1	snowden	2560838321	G15.1_2560838321_6	He collected large amounts of sensitive data.
G15.1	snowden	2560838321	G15.1_2560838321_7	Then, he got the data out of a highly secured IT organization, which had to learn from the press about the case.
G15.1	snowden	2560838321	G15.1_2560838321_8	In this article, I will explain such data-related risks in IT departments and how data loss prevention (DLP) tools help to manage them.
G15.1	snowden	1964597767	G15.1_1964597767_1	Current NSA forecast: continued Snowden flurries with no end in sight.
G15.1	snowden	1964597767	G15.1_1964597767_2	No one blames the hardworking NSA employees for the latest series of gaffes; itu0027s the feckless leadership and the politics that got them there that are responsible for our current difficulties.
G15.1	snowden	2074536042	G15.1_2074536042_1	In 2012 Edward Snowden starting releasing a cache of computer files to a small number of journalists, which he claimed to have copied from servers at the USu0027 National Security Agency (NSA).
G15.1	snowden	2074536042	G15.1_2074536042_2	The NSA have disputed the context or interpretation of some of the material published by the journalists, but have confirmed that Snowden had previously worked at the agency as an employee of an external firm Booz Hamilton.
G15.1	snowden	2074536042	G15.1_2074536042_3	The result of Snowdenu0027s revelations have included a large scale debate about the activities of both the USu0027 NSA and their partner agency in the UK (Government Communications Headquarters) in monitoring the communications of individuals and organisations worldwide.
G15.1	snowden	2074536042	G15.1_2074536042_4	"ACM SIGCAS makes an Award each year called the ""Making a Difference Award""."
G15.1	snowden	2074536042	G15.1_2074536042_5	Typically this has gone to a researcher in computer ethics or a practitioner or researcher in some other field of computer science whose work has had a significant socially beneficial impact.
G15.1	snowden	2074536042	G15.1_2074536042_6	In 2013 some members of SIGCAS engaged in an online debate about whether Snowden would be a worth recipient of this award.
G15.1	snowden	2074536042	G15.1_2074536042_7	The arguments put forth in this debate illuminate the divided opinions regarding Snowdenu0027s actions in the general population are also present in the computer ethics community.
G15.1	snowden	2074536042	G15.1_2074536042_8	A distillation of the arguments put forward are presented in this piece without individual attribution to the commenters.
G15.1	snowden	2427837044	G15.1_2427837044_1	The impact of the Edward Snowden scandal has only added to the need for the EU to increase the minimum security expectations for companiesu0027 networks and personal data protection.
G15.1	snowden	2427837044	G15.1_2427837044_2	The big problem is finding a way to manage information in a responsible and effective way.
G15.1	snowden	2427837044	G15.1_2427837044_3	From high-level government information to the credit card details of an Amazon shopper, the digital network is crammed full of confidential data, and its volume and size is growing rapidly each day.
G15.1	snowden	2427837044	G15.1_2427837044_4	The impact of the Edward Snowden scandal has only added to the need for the EU to increase the minimum security expectations for companiesu0027 networks.
G15.1	snowden	2427837044	G15.1_2427837044_5	New EU regulations are adding to the pressure on companies to ensure that unwanted data should be securely erased.
G15.1	snowden	2427837044	G15.1_2427837044_6	But this isnu0027t always as easy as it might seem, and itu0027s an area that requires the benefit of expert knowledge explains Phil Bridge of Kroll Ontrack Data Storage Technologies.

G15.1	snowden	2135459615	G15.1_2135459615_1	We are reaching the end of the second generation of knowledge management, with its focus on tacit‐explicit knowledge conversion.
G15.1	snowden	2135459615	G15.1_2135459615_2	Triggered by the SECI model of Nonaka, it replaced a first generation focus on timely information provision for decision support and in support of BPR initiatives.
G15.1	snowden	2135459615	G15.1_2135459615_3	Like BPR it has substantially failed to deliver on its promised benefits.
G15.1	snowden	2135459615	G15.1_2135459615_4	The third generation requires the clear separation of context, narrative and content management and challenges the orthodoxy of scientific management.
G15.1	snowden	2135459615	G15.1_2135459615_5	Complex adaptive systems theory is used to create a sense‐making model that utilises self‐organising capabilities of the informal communities and identifies a natural flow model of knowledge creation, disruption and utilisation.
G15.1	snowden	2135459615	G15.1_2135459615_6	However, the argument from nature of many complexity thinkers is rejected given the human capability to create order and predictability through collective and individual acts of freewill.
G15.1	snowden	2135459615	G15.1_2135459615_7	Knowledge is seen paradoxically, as both a thing and a flow requiring diverse management approaches.
G15.1	snowden	1997097062	G15.1_1997097062_1	This paper begins with a review of knowledge management (KM) literature, which highlights the problem that KM is interpreted in many different ways.
G15.1	snowden	1997097062	G15.1_1997097062_2	This is due to the fact that different authors make different assumptions about the nature of knowledge and the nature of knowing.
G15.1	snowden	1997097062	G15.1_1997097062_3	"Up until the mid-1990s, knowledge was defined as a ""thing""."
G15.1	snowden	1997097062	G15.1_1997097062_4	"In the late 1990s, there was a call to define knowledge not as a ""thing"" but as ""flows""."
G15.1	snowden	1997097062	G15.1_1997097062_5	The theories of Dervin and Snowden belong to the latter school of thought and are reviewed here.In the British Council, the design of knowledge management projects is informed by theories and research in the discourse of management, communications studies and information science.
G15.1	snowden	1997097062	G15.1_1997097062_6	In particular, the work of Dervin and Snowden has shaped our knowledge management journey.
G15.1	snowden	1997097062	G15.1_1997097062_7	This paper presents a specific example to provide in-depth insight on how we have designed a project debrief workshop that is informed by Dervinu0027s sense-making theory and Snowdenu0027s complexity theory.
G15.1	snowden	2295493888	G15.1_2295493888_1	"Ever since reporters began publishing stories about NSA activities, based on documents provided by Edward Snowden, weu0027ve been repeatedly assured by government officials that itu0027s ""only metadata."""
G15.1	snowden	2295493888	G15.1_2295493888_2	This might fool the average person, but it shouldnu0027t fool those of us in the security field.
G15.1	snowden	2295493888	G15.1_2295493888_3	Metadata equals surveillance data, and collecting metadata on people means putting them under surveillance.
G15.1	snowden	44531988	G15.1_44531988_1	Countries have been spying on each other for thousands of years, initially in a physical world but now predominantly in cyberspace.
G15.1	snowden	44531988	G15.1_44531988_2	Post 9/11 saw the implementation of surveillance legislation to protect national security but over the years, some countries and human rights civil organisations voiced concerns pertaining to some state-level espionage practices.
G15.1	snowden	44531988	G15.1_44531988_3	The characteristics of cyberspace provide for quick, easy, clandestine, anonymous, borderless, mass and asymmetrical state-on-state espionage which can be exploited to advance a state’s own interest.
G15.1	snowden	44531988	G15.1_44531988_4	In 2013 Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor, revealed US espionage practices conducted in collaboration with the UK Government Communications Headquarters.
G15.1	snowden	44531988	G15.1_44531988_5	The claims of unlimited surveillance confirmed some suspicions held of excessive state-level surveillance practices.
G15.1	snowden	44531988	G15.1_44531988_6	The US was quick to defend its surveillance practices as necessary for national security protection.
G15.1	snowden	44531988	G15.1_44531988_7	It pointed out that surveillance is conducted within a legal framework subject to approval and scrutiny.
G15.1	snowden	44531988	G15.1_44531988_8	The US in turn criticized China for out-of-control state-level economic espionage.
G15.1	snowden	44531988	G15.1_44531988_9	The post Snowden period sees countries considering legal solutions to restrict excessive espionage.
G15.1	snowden	44531988	G15.1_44531988_10	Is this quest doomed to be an exercise in futility or will countries put their own interests aside to advance a transparent and open cyberspace where state restraint is practiced?
G15.1	snowden	2615679613	G15.1_2615679613_1	Over the last decade, mobile devices and mobile applications have become pervasive in their usage.
G15.1	snowden	2615679613	G15.1_2615679613_2	Although many privacy risks associated with mobile applications have been investigated, prior work mainly focuses on the collection of user information by application developers and advertisers.
G15.1	snowden	2615679613	G15.1_2615679613_3	Inspired by the Snowden revelations, we study the ways mobile applications enable mass surveillance by sending unique identifiers over unencrypted connections.
G15.1	snowden	2615679613	G15.1_2615679613_4	Applying passive network fingerprinting, we show how a passive network adversary can improve his ability to target mobile users’ traffic.
G15.1	snowden	1975046353	G15.1_1975046353_1	In June 2013 Edward Snowden has transferred a set of sensitive documents to journalists, resulting in a continuous stream of revelations on mass surveillance by governments.
G15.1	snowden	1975046353	G15.1_1975046353_2	In this talk we present an overview of these revelations, we also discuss their impact on our understanding of mass surveillance practices and the security of ICT systems.
G15.1	snowden	1975046353	G15.1_1975046353_3	In particular, we discuss the known ways in which sophisticated attackers can bypass or undermine cryptography.
G15.1	snowden	1975046353	G15.1_1975046353_4	We conclude by analyzing how these revelations affect future research in information security and privacy.
G15.1	snowden	2404196383	G15.1_2404196383_1	The Internet community all over the world is showing growing interest in a subject of information security and anonymity on the Internet, especially after revelations of Edward Snowden, when it became known about mass spying by certain organizations (such as the US National Security Agency) on Internet users, companies, political organizations, etc.
G15.1	snowden	2404196383	G15.1_2404196383_2	This led to the active development of various anonymous networks, VPN services, proxies, etc.
G15.1	snowden	2404196383	G15.1_2404196383_3	The aim of this article is to review popular methods of providing Internet anonymity, compare them, and discover their benefits and disadvantages.
G15.1	snowden	790036197	G15.1_790036197_1	Nicht erst mit den Enthullungen des ehemaligen USGeheimdienstmitarbeiters Edward Snowden werden in Deutschland zunehmend Bedenken zum Datenschutz von onlinebasierten Sozialen Netzwerken geausert.

G15.1	snowden	2255813332	G15.1_2255813332_1	Governments and corporations gather, store, and analyze the tremendous amount of data we chuff out as we move through our digitized lives.
G15.1	snowden	2255813332	G15.1_2255813332_2	Often this is without our knowledge, and typically without our consent.
G15.1	snowden	2255813332	G15.1_2255813332_3	Based on this data, they draw conclusions about us that we might disagree with or object to, and that can impact our lives in profound ways.
G15.1	snowden	2255813332	G15.1_2255813332_4	We may not like to admit it, but we are under mass surveillance.
G15.1	snowden	2255813332	G15.1_2255813332_5	Much of what we know about the United States National Security Agency (NSA)’s surveillance comes from Edward Snowden, although people both before and after him also leaked agency secrets.
G15.1	snowden	2398582829	G15.1_2398582829_1	Cryptography rearranges power: it configures who can do what, from what.
G15.1	snowden	2398582829	G15.1_2398582829_2	This makes cryptography an inherently political tool, and it confers on the field an intrinsically moral dimension.
G15.1	snowden	2398582829	G15.1_2398582829_3	The Snowden revelations motivate a reassessment of the political and moral positioning of cryptography.
G15.1	snowden	2398582829	G15.1_2398582829_4	They lead one to ask if our inability to effectively address mass surveillance constitutes a failure of our field.
G15.1	snowden	2398582829	G15.1_2398582829_5	I believe that it does.
G15.1	snowden	2398582829	G15.1_2398582829_6	I call for a community-wide effort to develop more effective means to resist mass surveillance.
G15.1	snowden	2398582829	G15.1_2398582829_7	I plead for a reinvention of our disciplinary culture to attend not only to puzzles and math, but, also, to the societal implications of our work.
G15.1	snowden	2088276341	G15.1_2088276341_1	Recent data breaches caused by highly-privileged insiders (e.g.
G15.1	snowden	2088276341	G15.1_2088276341_2	the NSA/Snowden case) as well as the proliferation of mobile and cloud applications in enterprises imposes new challenges for Identity Management.
G15.1	snowden	2088276341	G15.1_2088276341_3	To cope with these challenges, business analysts have predicted a variety of trends for enterprise Identity Management.
G15.1	snowden	2088276341	G15.1_2088276341_4	In this paper, we conduct a thorough literature analysis to examine to which extent the scientific community seizes upon these trends and identify major research areas therein.
G15.1	snowden	2088276341	G15.1_2088276341_5	Results show that despite the analystsu0027 predictions, research stagnates for attribute-based access control and privileged user management, while for cloud-based IdM and bring your own device it corresponds to the analystsu0027 forecast.
G15.1	snowden	2249417588	G15.1_2249417588_1	Motivated in part by the Snowden revelations, we address the question of whether intelligence and lawenforcement agencies can gather actionable, relevant information about unknown electronic targets without conducting dragnet surveillance.
G15.1	snowden	2249417588	G15.1_2249417588_2	We formulate principles that we believe effective, lawful surveillance protocols should adhere to in an era of big data and global communication networks.
G15.1	snowden	2249417588	G15.1_2249417588_3	We then focus on intersection of cell-tower dumps, a specific surveillance operation that the FBI has used effectively.
G15.1	snowden	2249417588	G15.1_2249417588_4	As a case study, we present a system that computes such intersections in a privacypreserving, accountable fashion.
G15.1	snowden	2249417588	G15.1_2249417588_5	Preliminary experiments indicate that such a system could be efficient and usable, suggesting that privacy and accountability need not be barriers to effective intelligence gathering.
G15.2	cookies	2892196156	G15.2_2892196156_1	While browsing the web, cookies are stored on useru0027s computers.
G15.2	cookies	2892196156	G15.2_2892196156_2	"Some of these cookies are ""third-party"" cookies that can track the user across different websites."
G15.2	cookies	2892196156	G15.2_2892196156_3	In this paper, we summarize what third-party cookies (trackers) are and the different types there are.
G15.2	cookies	2892196156	G15.2_2892196156_4	We use a browser extension to examine what third party trackers are detected on popular websites.
G15.2	cookies	2892196156	G15.2_2892196156_5	From the data collected, we examined the cookies on each website and identified common cookies.
G15.2	cookies	2892196156	G15.2_2892196156_6	Finally, we offered solutions on how to protect browsers from unwanted third-party cookies.
G15.2	cookies	2162763684	G15.2_2162763684_1	This is a pilot study of the use of u0027Flash cookiesu0027 by popular websites.
G15.2	cookies	2162763684	G15.2_2162763684_2	We find that more than 50% of the sites in our sample are using flash cookies to store information about the user.
G15.2	cookies	2162763684	G15.2_2162763684_3	Some are using it to u0027respawnu0027 or re-instantiate HTTP cookies deleted by the user.
G15.2	cookies	2162763684	G15.2_2162763684_4	Flash cookies often share the same values as HTTP cookies, and are even used on government websites to assign unique values to users.
G15.2	cookies	2162763684	G15.2_2162763684_5	Privacy policies rarely disclose the presence of Flash cookies, and user controls for effectuating privacy preferences are lacking.
G15.2	cookies	2099035338	G15.2_2099035338_1	Web servers and browsers typically use cookies to capture information for subsequent communications, which provides continuity and state across HTTP connections.
G15.2	cookies	2099035338	G15.2_2099035338_2	At present, Internet e-commerce is somewhat limited in using cookies because sensitive information cannot be securely stored and communicated in typical cookies.
G15.2	cookies	2099035338	G15.2_2099035338_3	Secure cookies offer a potential solution to this problem.
G15.2	cookies	2001829274	G15.2_2001829274_1	Abstract This article first identifies and exactly defines “cookies” and “Web bugs.” the contents (code) of cookies and Web bugs are next examined through several examples.
G15.2	cookies	2001829274	G15.2_2001829274_2	the useful business value of cookies and Web bugs is examined, followed by a discussion of the threats, invasion of privacy, and other issues.
G15.2	cookies	2001829274	G15.2_2001829274_3	Finally, the powerful possibilities through the synchronization of Web bugs and cookies working together (even in Word documents) are examined.
G15.2	cookies	2055128206	G15.2_2055128206_1	Despite the widespread use and adoption of cookies as the basis for web applications to keep state information, cookies present some design issues that are yet to be fully addressed.
G15.2	cookies	2055128206	G15.2_2055128206_2	The fact that cookies are stored on client-sideu0027s memory means that they are tightly coupled to the machine that is interacting with the web server.
G15.2	cookies	2055128206	G15.2_2055128206_3	Yet often, these cookies are initiated by web applications to identify useru0027s preferences and identifications.
G15.2	cookies	2055128206	G15.2_2055128206_4	As the user moves across different machines to access the same site, the information previously recorded is lost and the web application has no way of restoring the state, unless the user revisits the same client machine, where the original cookies were set.
G15.2	cookies	2055128206	G15.2_2055128206_5	"This paper presents a novel solution to address the need for cookies to be ""mobile"" by leveraging on smart card to manage cookies, with the benefit of mobility in a pocket."
G15.2	cookies	2055128206	G15.2_2055128206_6	We describe the design and implementation of the CookiesCard framework that uses smart card as a secure and mobile storage media to manage personalized cookies.
G15.2	cookies	2055128206	G15.2_2055128206_7	The article presents the development of the CookiesCard proxy that directly interacts with the smart card to provide cookies management, while acting as an intermediatary between the client browser and a web server.
G15.2	cookies	3003315098	G15.2_3003315098_1	With CookiesCard, cookies are stored on usersu0027 smart cards, coupling cookies to users, not to their machines.
G15.2	cookies	1502287064	G15.2_1502287064_1	The HTTP does not support continuity for browser-server interaction between successive visits of a user due to a stateless feature.
G15.2	cookies	1502287064	G15.2_1502287064_2	Cookies were invented to maintain continuity and state on the Web.
G15.2	cookies	1502287064	G15.2_1502287064_3	Because cookies are transmitted in plain and contain text-character strings encoding relevant information about the user, the attacker can easily copy and modify them for his undue profit.
G15.2	cookies	1502287064	G15.2_1502287064_4	In this paper, we design a secure cookies scheme based on public key certificate for solving these security weakness of typical web cookies.
G15.2	cookies	1502287064	G15.2_1502287064_5	Our secure cookies scheme provides not only mutual authentication between client and server but also confidentiality and integrity of user information.
G15.2	cookies	1502287064	G15.2_1502287064_6	Additionally, we implement our secure cookies scheme and compare it to the performance with SSL (Secure Socket Layer) protocol that is widely used for security of HTTP environment.
G15.2	cookies	1537732843	G15.2_1537732843_1	Current Linux kernels include a facility called TCP SYN cookies, conceived to face SYN flooding attacks.
G15.2	cookies	1537732843	G15.2_1537732843_2	However, the current implementation of SYN cookies does not support the negotiation of TCP options, although some of them are relevant for throughput performance, such as large windows or selective acknowledgment.
G15.2	cookies	1537732843	G15.2_1537732843_3	In this paper we present an improvement of the SYN cookie protocol, using all the current mechanisms for generating and validating cookies while allowing connections negotiated with SYN cookies to set up and use any TCP options.
G15.2	cookies	1537732843	G15.2_1537732843_4	The key idea is to exploit a kind of TCP connection called “simultaneous connection initiation” in order to lead client hosts to send together TCP options and SYN cookies to a server being attacked.
G15.2	cookies	2339675877	G15.2_2339675877_1	Web cookies are used widely by publishers and 3rd parties to track users and their behaviors.
G15.2	cookies	2339675877	G15.2_2339675877_2	Despite the ubiquitous use of cookies, there is little prior work on their characteristics such as standard attributes, placement policies, and the knowledge that can be amassed via 3rd party cookies.
G15.2	cookies	2339675877	G15.2_2339675877_3	In this paper, we present an empirical study of web cookie characteristics, placement practices and information transmission.
G15.2	cookies	2339675877	G15.2_2339675877_4	To conduct this study, we implemented a lightweight web crawler that tracks and stores the cookies as it navigates to websites.
G15.2	cookies	2339675877	G15.2_2339675877_5	We use this crawler to collect over 3.2M cookies from the two crawls, separated by 18 months, of the top 100K Alexa web sites.
G15.2	cookies	2339675877	G15.2_2339675877_6	We report on the general cookie characteristics and add context via a cookie category index and website genre labels.
G15.2	cookies	2339675877	G15.2_2339675877_7	We consider privacy implications by examining specific cookie attributes and placement behavior of 3rd party cookies.
G15.2	cookies	2339675877	G15.2_2339675877_8	We find that 3rd party cookies outnumber 1st party cookies by a factor of two, and we illuminate the connection between domain genres and cookie attributes.
G15.2	cookies	2339675877	G15.2_2339675877_9	We find that less than 1% of the entities that place cookies can aggregate information across 75% of web sites.
G15.2	cookies	2339675877	G15.2_2339675877_10	Finally, we consider the issue of information transmission and aggregation by domains via 3rd party cookies.
G15.2	cookies	2339675877	G15.2_2339675877_11	We develop a mathematical framework to quantify user information leakage for a broad class of users, and present findings using real world domains.
G15.2	cookies	2339675877	G15.2_2339675877_12	In particular, we demonstrate the interplay between a domainu0027s footprint across the Internet and the browsing behavior of users, which has significant impact on information transmission.
G15.2	cookies	2743005686	G15.2_2743005686_1	Users online are commonly tracked using HTTP cookies when browsing on the web.
G15.2	cookies	2743005686	G15.2_2743005686_2	To protect their privacy, users tend to use simple tools to block the activity of HTTP cookies.
G15.2	cookies	2743005686	G15.2_2743005686_3	However, the “block all” design of tools breaks critical web services or severely limits the online advertising ecosystem.
G15.2	cookies	2743005686	G15.2_2743005686_4	Therefore, to ease this tension, a more nuanced strategy that discerns better the intended functionality of the HTTP cookies users encounter is required.
G15.2	cookies	2743005686	G15.2_2743005686_5	We present the first large-scale study of the use of HTTP cookies in the wild using network traces containing more than 5.6 billion HTTP requests from real users for a period of two and a half months.
G15.2	cookies	2743005686	G15.2_2743005686_6	We first present a statistical analysis of how cookies are used.
G15.2	cookies	2743005686	G15.2_2743005686_7	We then analyze the structure of cookies and observe that; HTTP cookies are significantly more sophisticated than the name=value defined by the standard and assumed by researchers and developers.
G15.2	cookies	2743005686	G15.2_2743005686_8	Based on our findings we present an algorithm that is able to extract the information included in 86% of the cookies in our dataset with an accuracy of 91.7%.
G15.2	cookies	2743005686	G15.2_2743005686_9	Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings and provide solutions that can be used to improve the most promising privacy preserving tools.
G15.2	cookies	1749834041	G15.2_1749834041_1	Current approaches to access control on Web servers do not scale to enterprise-wide systems, since they are mostly based on individual users.
G15.2	cookies	1749834041	G15.2_1749834041_2	Therefore, we were motivated by the need to manage and enforce the strong access control technology of RBAC in large-scale Web environments.
G15.2	cookies	1749834041	G15.2_1749834041_3	Cookies can be used to support RBAC on the Web, holding users’ role information.
G15.2	cookies	1749834041	G15.2_1749834041_4	However, it is insecure to store and transmit sensitive information in cookies.
G15.2	cookies	1749834041	G15.2_1749834041_5	Cookies are stored and transmitted in clear text, which is readable and easily forged.
G15.2	cookies	1749834041	G15.2_1749834041_6	In this paper, we describe an implementation of Role-Based Access Control with role hierarchies on the Web by secure cookies.
G15.2	cookies	1749834041	G15.2_1749834041_7	Since a user’s role information is contained in a set of secure cookies and transmitted to the corresponding Web servers, these servers can trust the role information in the cookies after cookie-verification procedures and use it for role-based access control.
G15.2	cookies	1749834041	G15.2_1749834041_8	In our implementation, we used CGI scripts and PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) to provide security services to secure cookies.
G15.2	cookies	1749834041	G15.2_1749834041_9	The approach is transparent to users and applicable to existing Web servers and browsers.
G15.2	cookies	2165679316	G15.2_2165679316_1	Cookies, the HTTP state management mechanism, are the backbone of many web applications.
G15.2	cookies	2165679316	G15.2_2165679316_2	Despite a high adoption rate, cookies have remained virtually unexplored by the academic community.
G15.2	cookies	2165679316	G15.2_2165679316_3	This paper presents an EBNF grammatical definition and a three- tiered testing strategy for cookies.
G15.2	cookies	2165679316	G15.2_2165679316_4	The testing strategy builds upon anti-random and grammar-based methodologies examining cookies from three perspectives: cookies collections, individual cookie transformations and application-specific test-case generation.
G15.2	cookies	2165679316	G15.2_2165679316_5	The collection of cookies maintained within a user-agent are explored in light of the anti-random test- suite reduction techniques and the grammatical definition of a cookie, culminating in the definition of a number of seeding test-vectors providing the basis for a scalable test-suite.
G15.2	cookies	2165679316	G15.2_2165679316_6	A number of distinct grammatically correct cookie transformations are presented, providing further scalability to the proposed testing strategy.
G15.2	cookies	2165679316	G15.2_2165679316_7	Finally a discussion of application-specific cookie transformations is presented, with focus upon the security and reliability concerns of modern web applications.

G15.2	cookies	2950029488	G15.2_2950029488_3	I will also offer a personal perspective on how what began as a straightforward technical specification turned into a political flashpoint when it tried to address non-technical issues such as privacy.

G15.2	cookies	2020380418	G15.2_2020380418_1	This paper arose from a question: why are there so many connections between cookies and the Internet?
G15.2	cookies	2020380418	G15.2_2020380418_2	We describe some of these connections.
G15.2	cookies	2020380418	G15.2_2020380418_3	Cookies appear in contexts that have to do with giving and sharing.
G15.2	cookies	2020380418	G15.2_2020380418_4	We explore the larger social context of cookies as food, as a gift for children, and as a symbol of sharing, and also the relationship between women and giving.
G15.2	cookies	2020380418	G15.2_2020380418_5	There turns out to be a connection between the Internet gift economy, the U.S. tradition of giving cookies as a present, and the future of the Internet.
G15.2	cookies	2020380418	G15.2_2020380418_6	We describe this connection and its implication for Internet strategies.
G15.2	cookies	2048406491	G15.2_2048406491_1	Cross Site Scripting (XSS) makes victims execute an arbitrary script and leaks out personal information from victimsu0027 computers.
G15.2	cookies	2048406491	G15.2_2048406491_2	An adversary can easily get victimu0027s cookies by the XSS attack.
G15.2	cookies	2048406491	G15.2_2048406491_3	If the adversary cannot use the stolen cookies to impersonate the victim, stealing cookie has no meaning.
G15.2	cookies	2048406491	G15.2_2048406491_4	Therefore, we propose a method to prohibit the abuse of stolen cookies in order to make it ineffective to steal cookies through the XXS attack.
G15.2	cookies	2048406491	G15.2_2048406491_5	The proposed method uses one-time password and challenge-response authentication to identify whether a person is a valid owner of the cookie or not.
G15.2	cookies	2783567705	G15.2_2783567705_1	The use of cookies to profile individuals has been raising serious privacy protection concerns.
G15.2	cookies	2783567705	G15.2_2783567705_2	Many countries have already enacted privacy protection laws to create legal framework to mitigate these concerns.
G15.2	cookies	2783567705	G15.2_2783567705_3	This paper presents an analysis of setting of cookies on usersu0027 computers by websites in a sample of Commonwealth countries, and evaluates compliance of the cookies-setting websites with privacy protection laws of the countries where the websites are hosted.
G15.2	cookies	2783567705	G15.2_2783567705_4	Also, the rate at which third-party cookies are being set was monitored and the findings were used to estimate probability of a useru0027s Internet activities being tracked on the websites in the Commonwealth countries.
G15.2	cookies	1981057422	G15.2_1981057422_1	User session is the key part of web log processing.
G15.2	cookies	1981057422	G15.2_1981057422_2	Due to incomplete sessions, we should compare each Cookie pair for the session to be merged.
G15.2	cookies	1981057422	G15.2_1981057422_3	But only a few Cookie pairs can be used by websites for identification.
G15.2	cookies	1981057422	G15.2_1981057422_4	In this paper, two algorithms are proposed to identify user-Cookies and terminal-Cookies.
G15.2	cookies	1981057422	G15.2_1981057422_5	With these key-Cookies the process of session merging is improved.
G15.2	cookies	2588590439	G15.2_2588590439_1	Nixtamalized corn flour (NCF) has a good dietary fiber profile that makes it an alternative to produce gluten-free cookies because upon hydration and mixing it yields a cohesive and machinable dough.
G15.2	cookies	2588590439	G15.2_2588590439_2	In order to improve the texture and acceptance of cookies, five different experimental treatments were devised and compared with a cookie made with refined wheat flour.
G15.2	cookies	2588590439	G15.2_2588590439_3	A waxy native maize or pregelatinized cross-linked starches in concentrations of 5% and 10% were evaluated.
G15.2	cookies	2588590439	G15.2_2588590439_4	Results showed that the spread factor, diameter, and thickness of the different types of cookies were not statistically different ().
G15.2	cookies	2588590439	G15.2_2588590439_5	With the exception of the control and cookies made with 10% waxy starch which were rated with lower scores, the rest of the treatments were not significantly different in terms of sensory attributes.
G15.2	cookies	2588590439	G15.2_2588590439_6	The texture of cookies evaluated by panelists related to the objective texture was determined with the texture analyzer.
G15.2	cookies	2588590439	G15.2_2588590439_7	Cookies made from the composite flour containing 10% pregelatinized cross-linked were softer or had lower maximum positive force after 5 days of storage.
G15.2	cookies	2588590439	G15.2_2588590439_8	This particular gluten-free cookie contained 65% more dietary fiber compared to the wheat flour counterpart and had the best sensory attributes among all treatments including the cookie made with refined wheat flour.
G15.3	gdpr	2953043009	G15.3_2953043009_1	Starting from 25th May 2018, the EU Regulation 2016/679, known as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) - relating to the protection of individuals with regard to the processing and free circulation of personal data - is directly applicable in all Member States.
G15.3	gdpr	2953043009	G15.3_2953043009_2	The application of the GDPR caught a lot of companies and institutions unprepared and off guard.
G15.3	gdpr	2953043009	G15.3_2953043009_3	One of the most complex activities that the GDPR requires is the Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA).
G15.3	gdpr	2953043009	G15.3_2953043009_4	The aim of this paper is to provide an Expert System that is able to draw up the DPIA, and a prototype is shown.
G15.3	gdpr	2914475989	G15.3_2914475989_1	The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) recognizes data subject’s consent as a legitimate ground of data processing.
G15.3	gdpr	2914475989	G15.3_2914475989_2	At present, consent mechanisms in OSNs are either non-existent or not GDPR compliant.
G15.3	gdpr	2914475989	G15.3_2914475989_3	While the absence of consent means a lack of control of the OSN user (data subject) on his personal data, non-compliant consent mechanisms can give them a false sense of control, encouraging them to reveal more personal data than they would have otherwise.
G15.3	gdpr	2914475989	G15.3_2914475989_4	GDPR compliance is thus the only way to obtain meaningful consents, thereby protecting user privacy.
G15.3	gdpr	2914475989	G15.3_2914475989_5	In this paper, we discuss the characteristics of valid consent as per the GDPR, analyze the present status of consent in OSNs and propose some research directions to arrive at GDPR compliant consent models acceptable to users and OSN providers (data controller).
G15.3	gdpr	2914475989	G15.3_2914475989_6	We observe that evaluating privacy risks of consents to data processing activities can be an effective way to help users in their decision to give or refuse consents and hence is an important research direction.
G15.3	gdpr	2902224053	G15.3_2902224053_1	Disclosing personal data for a purpose not known by data subjects is a practice that the 2018 European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is supposed to prevent.
G15.3	gdpr	2902224053	G15.3_2902224053_2	This article gives an overview of the major aspects of GDPR related to provision, use, and maintenance of cloud services and technologies.
G15.3	gdpr	2766353613	G15.3_2766353613_1	Privacy is a key aspect for the European Union (EU), where it is regulated by a specific law, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
G15.3	gdpr	2766353613	G15.3_2766353613_2	Compliance to the GDPR is a problem for organizations, it imposes strict constraints whenever they deal with personal data and, in case of infringement, it specifies severe consequences such as legal and monetary penalties.
G15.3	gdpr	2766353613	G15.3_2766353613_3	Such organizations frequently are complex systems, where personal data is processed by humans and technical services.
G15.3	gdpr	2766353613	G15.3_2766353613_4	Therefore, it becomes fundamental to consider privacy from the social perspective when designing such system, i.e., when relations between different components are specified.
G15.3	gdpr	2766353613	G15.3_2766353613_5	This is, indeed, also specified in the GDPR, which encourages to apply privacy-by-design principles.
G15.3	gdpr	2766353613	G15.3_2766353613_6	This paper proposes a method to support the design of GDPR compliant systems, based on a socio-technical approach composed of a modeling language and a reasoning framework.
G15.3	gdpr	2946717634	G15.3_2946717634_1	In recent years, our society is being plagued by unprecedented levels of privacy and security breaches.
G15.3	gdpr	2946717634	G15.3_2946717634_2	To rein in this trend, the European Union, in 2018, introduced a comprehensive legislation called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
G15.3	gdpr	2946717634	G15.3_2946717634_3	In this paper, we review GDPR from a system design perspective, and identify how its regulations conflict with the design, architecture, and operation of modern systems.
G15.3	gdpr	2946717634	G15.3_2946717634_4	We illustrate these conflicts via the seven GDPR sins: storing data forever; reusing data indiscriminately; walled gardens and black markets; risk-agnostic data processing; hiding data breaches; making unexplainable decisions; treating security as a secondary goal.
G15.3	gdpr	2946717634	G15.3_2946717634_5	Our findings reveal a deep-rooted tussle between GDPR requirements and how modern systems have evolved.
G15.3	gdpr	2946717634	G15.3_2946717634_6	We believe that achieving compliance requires comprehensive, grounds up solutions, and anything short would amount to fixing a leaky faucet in a sinking ship.
G15.3	gdpr	3007495176	G15.3_3007495176_1	The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) gives control of data to the data owner.
G15.3	gdpr	3007495176	G15.3_3007495176_2	It imposes several requirements and obligations on organizations that process and manage personal data of EU citizens.
G15.3	gdpr	3007495176	G15.3_3007495176_3	GDPR uses consent as a legal basis for personal data processing.
G15.3	gdpr	3007495176	G15.3_3007495176_4	We design a semantic model to represent GDPR consents; our model is explicit, understandable, and reusable.
G15.3	gdpr	3007495176	G15.3_3007495176_5	Ensuring that organizations comply with GDPR with respect to user consents is a critical issue.
G15.3	gdpr	3007495176	G15.3_3007495176_6	To address such an issue, we propose a Blockchain-based model for compliance verification.
G15.3	gdpr	3007495176	G15.3_3007495176_7	Our decentralized model ensures that only parties authorized based on users’ consent can access users’ data and that all activities are logged in an immutable distributed ledger.
G15.3	gdpr	3007495176	G15.3_3007495176_8	Our GDPR privacy protection framework is cast into the XACML reference architecture.
G15.3	gdpr	2954372446	G15.3_2954372446_1	The advent of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) imposes organizations to cope with radical changes concerning user data protection paradigms.
G15.3	gdpr	2954372446	G15.3_2954372446_2	GDPR, by promoting a Privacy by Design approach, obliges organizations to drastically change their methods regarding user data acquisition, management, processing, as well as data breaches monitoring, notification and preparation of prevention plans.
G15.3	gdpr	2954372446	G15.3_2954372446_3	This enforces data subjects (e.g., citizens, customers) rights by enabling them to have more information regarding usage of their data, and to take decisions (e.g., revoking usage permissions).
G15.3	gdpr	2954372446	G15.3_2954372446_4	Moreover, organizations are required to trace precisely their activities on user data, enabling authorities to monitor and sanction more easily.
G15.3	gdpr	2954372446	G15.3_2954372446_5	Indeed, since GDPR has been introduced, authorities have heavily sanctioned companies found as not GDPR compliant.
G15.3	gdpr	2954372446	G15.3_2954372446_6	GDPR is difficult to apply also for its length, complexity, covering many aspects, and not providing details concerning technical and organizational security measures to apply.
G15.3	gdpr	2954372446	G15.3_2954372446_7	This calls for tools and methods able to support organizations in achieving GDPR compliance.
G15.3	gdpr	2954372446	G15.3_2954372446_8	From the industry and the literature, there are many tools and prototypes fulfilling specific/isolated GDPR aspects, however there is not a comprehensive platform able to support organizations in being compliant regarding all GDPR requirements.
G15.3	gdpr	2954372446	G15.3_2954372446_9	In this paper, we propose the design of an architecture for such a platform, able to reuse and integrate peculiarities of those heterogeneous tools, and to support organizations in achieving GDPR compliance.
G15.3	gdpr	2954372446	G15.3_2954372446_10	We describe the architecture, designed within the DEFeND EU project, and discuss challenges and preliminary benefits in applying it to the healthcare and energy domains.
G15.3	gdpr	2996000302	G15.3_2996000302_1	Recently, a stringent set of privacy regulations, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), was enacted in the European Union, which can be considered a privacy non-functional requirement (NFR).
G15.3	gdpr	2996000302	G15.3_2996000302_2	As a result, an organization that collects or processes data from European citizens must adhere to the GDPR.
G15.3	gdpr	2996000302	G15.3_2996000302_3	Previous studies have shown that compliance to the GDPR poses a number of challenges, which we have confirmed in our own research.
G15.3	gdpr	2996000302	G15.3_2996000302_4	In this paper, we describe our ongoing research collaboration with a startup organization that is adopting the GDPR.
G15.3	gdpr	2996000302	G15.3_2996000302_5	In addition, during the course of our research, we found that our industry collaborator, practices continuous integration (CI) like many other organizations.
G15.3	gdpr	2996000302	G15.3_2996000302_6	The number of organizations adopting CI has increased since Fowler first published his definition of CI.
G15.3	gdpr	2996000302	G15.3_2996000302_7	As such, another aspect of our current research is exploring the effects of CI on privacy NFRs and other NFRs.
G15.3	gdpr	2996000302	G15.3_2996000302_8	Finally, we describe a design science approach to iteratively learn about industry challenges in GDPR compliance, NFRs in the context of CI, as well as our ongoing work creating a tool to potentially mitigate observed GDPR compliance challenges.
G15.3	gdpr	2933389990	G15.3_2933389990_1	In May 2018, GDPR came into effect in the European Union, placing additional requirements for data sensitive companies on data protection.
G15.3	gdpr	2933389990	G15.3_2933389990_2	For persuasive systems which deal with users’ data, taking GDPR into consideration in the design phase is necessary.
G15.3	gdpr	2933389990	G15.3_2933389990_3	This paper analyzes and summarizes the requirements by GDPR and discusses how they affect persuasive systems design in terms of design requirements and cost implications.
G15.3	gdpr	2529000976	G15.3_2529000976_1	Breach or lack of online privacy has become almost a commonplace of today’s digital age, mainly due to the inability of either enforcing privacy requirements or imposing strict sanctions against violations.
G15.3	gdpr	2529000976	G15.3_2529000976_2	The current state of affairs in data privacy is at a turning point for companies operating in EU state members as the enforcement of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) empowers users with control over their personal data, including regulating its disclosure, withdrawing disclosure consent at any given time and tracking their data trail.
G15.3	gdpr	2529000976	G15.3_2529000976_3	Compliance with the GDPR is mandatory and it requires signifiant amendments and/or restructuring of data processing routines undertaken by enterprises.
G15.3	gdpr	2529000976	G15.3_2529000976_4	Currently, there is no framework to support the GDPR principles.
G15.3	gdpr	2529000976	G15.3_2529000976_5	This paper proposes privacyTracker, a GDPR-compliant framework that supports basic GDPR principles including data traceability and allowing a user to get a cryptographically verifiable snapshot of his/her data trail.
G15.3	gdpr	2886119610	G15.3_2886119610_1	The rollout of European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR) will have a far-reaching effect on Cloud data privacy and compliance for both the Cloud Service Providers (Data Providers) and the Consumers (Data Consumers).
G15.3	gdpr	2886119610	G15.3_2886119610_2	GDPR mandates that organizations collecting and processing information related to EU citizens adhere to its articles irrespective of where they are located or where the data is stored.
G15.3	gdpr	2886119610	G15.3_2886119610_3	This regulation is currently available only in the textual format and so requires significant manual effort to  ensure its compliance.
G15.3	gdpr	2886119610	G15.3_2886119610_4	We have developed a semantically rich Ontology (or knowledge graph) to represent the rules and regulations mandated for both the cloud data consumers and providers by EU GDPR.
G15.3	gdpr	2886119610	G15.3_2886119610_5	In the Ontology, we have identified the different roles and their corresponding obligations under the GDPR articles.
G15.3	gdpr	2886119610	G15.3_2886119610_6	This knowledge graph, that is available in public domain, is machine processable and will help in automating EU GDPR regulation compliance.
G15.3	gdpr	2807262125	G15.3_2807262125_1	The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the new European data protection law whose compliance affects organisations in several aspects related to the use of consent and personal data.
G15.3	gdpr	2807262125	G15.3_2807262125_2	With emerging research and innovation in data management solutions claiming assistance with various provisions of the GDPR, the task of comparing the degree and scope of such solutions is a challenge without a way to consolidate them.
G15.3	gdpr	2807262125	G15.3_2807262125_3	With GDPR as a linked data resource, it is possible to link together information and approaches addressing specific articles and thereby compare them.
G15.3	gdpr	2807262125	G15.3_2807262125_4	Organisations can take advantage of this by linking queries and results directly to the relevant text, thereby making it possible to record and measure their solutions for compliance towards specific obligations.
G15.3	gdpr	2807262125	G15.3_2807262125_5	GDPR text extensions (GDPRtEXT) uses the European Legislation Identifier (ELI) ontology published by the European Publications Office for exposing the GDPR as linked data.
G15.3	gdpr	2807262125	G15.3_2807262125_6	The dataset is published using DCAT and includes an online webpage with HTML id attributes for each article and its subpoints.
G15.3	gdpr	2807262125	G15.3_2807262125_7	A SKOS vocabulary is provided that links concepts with the relevant text in GDPR.
G15.3	gdpr	2807262125	G15.3_2807262125_8	To demonstrate how related legislations can be linked to highlight changes between them for reusing existing approaches, we provide a mapping from Data Protection Directive (DPD), which was the previous data protection law, to GDPR showing the nature of changes between the two legislations.
G15.3	gdpr	2807262125	G15.3_2807262125_9	We also discuss in brief the existing corpora of research that can benefit from the adoption of this resource.
G15.3	gdpr	2947974951	G15.3_2947974951_1	Since the adoption of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018, designing software systems that conform to the GDPR principles has become vital.
G15.3	gdpr	2947974951	G15.3_2947974951_2	Modeling languages can be a facilitator for this process, following the principles of model-driven development.
G15.3	gdpr	2947974951	G15.3_2947974951_3	In this paper, we present our work on the usage of a π-calculus-based language for modeling and reasoning about the GDPR provisions of 1) lawfulness of processing by providing consent, 2) consent withdrawal, and 3) right to erasure.
G15.3	gdpr	2947974951	G15.3_2947974951_4	A static analysis method based on type checking is proposed to validate that a model conforms to associated privacy requirements.
G15.3	gdpr	2947974951	G15.3_2947974951_5	This is the first step towards a rigorous Privacy-By-Design methodology for analyzing and validating a software system model against the GDPR.
G15.3	gdpr	2947974951	G15.3_2947974951_6	A use case is presented to discuss and illustrate the framework.
G15.3	gdpr	2979635651	G15.3_2979635651_1	Health data comes within a personu0027s most intimate sphere.
G15.3	gdpr	2979635651	G15.3_2979635651_2	It is therefore considered to be sensitive data due to the great impact it could have on a personu0027s life if this data were freely available.
G15.3	gdpr	2979635651	G15.3_2979635651_3	Unauthorised disclosure may lead to various forms of discrimination and violation of fundamental rights.
G15.3	gdpr	2979635651	G15.3_2979635651_4	Rapid modern technological developments bring enormous benefits to society.
G15.3	gdpr	2979635651	G15.3_2979635651_5	However, with this digitisation, massive amounts of health data are generated.
G15.3	gdpr	2979635651	G15.3_2979635651_6	This makes our health data vulnerable, especially when transferred across borders.
G15.3	gdpr	2979635651	G15.3_2979635651_7	The new EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) legal framework provides for rights for users of modern technologies (data subjects) and obligations for companies (controllers and processors) with regard to processing of personal data.
G15.3	gdpr	2979635651	G15.3_2979635651_8	Chapter V of the GDPR protects personal data that are transferred to third countries, outside the EU.
G15.3	gdpr	2979635651	G15.3_2979635651_9	The term u0027transferu0027 itself however is not defined by the GDPR.
G15.3	gdpr	2979635651	G15.3_2979635651_10	This paper examines whether transfer within the meaning of the GDPR applies to health data processed by modern technologies and if the complexity of the GDPR legal framework as such sufficiently reflects reality and protects health data that moves across borders, in particular to jurisdictions outside the EU.
G05.2	crispr	2165011752	G05.2_2165011752_1	Well-studied innate immune systems exist throughout bacteria and archaea, but a more recently discovered genomic locus may offer prokaryotes surprising immunological adaptability.
G05.2	crispr	2165011752	G05.2_2165011752_2	Mediated by a cassette-like genomic locus termed Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR), the microbial adaptive immune system differs from its eukaryotic immune analogues by incorporating new immunities unidirectionally.
G05.2	crispr	2165011752	G05.2_2165011752_3	CRISPR thus stores genomically recoverable timelines of virus-host coevolution in natural organisms refractory to laboratory cultivation.
G05.2	crispr	2165011752	G05.2_2165011752_4	Here we combined a population genetic mathematical model of CRISPR-virus coevolution with six years of metagenomic sequencing to link the recoverable genomic dynamics of CRISPR loci to the unknown population dynamics of virus and host in natural communities.
G05.2	crispr	2165011752	G05.2_2165011752_5	Metagenomic reconstructions in an acid-mine drainage system document CRISPR loci conserving ancestral immune elements to the base-pair across thousands of microbial generations.
G05.2	crispr	2165011752	G05.2_2165011752_6	This ‘trailer-end conservation’ occurs despite rapid viral mutation and despite rapid prokaryotic genomic deletion.
G05.2	crispr	2165011752	G05.2_2165011752_7	The trailer-ends of many reconstructed CRISPR loci are also largely identical across a population.
G05.2	crispr	2165011752	G05.2_2165011752_8	‘Trailer-end clonality’ occurs despite predictions of host immunological diversity due to negative frequency dependent selection (kill the winner dynamics).
G05.2	crispr	2165011752	G05.2_2165011752_9	Statistical clustering and model simulations explain this lack of diversity by capturing rapid selective sweeps by highly immune CRISPR lineages.
G05.2	crispr	2165011752	G05.2_2165011752_10	Potentially explaining ‘trailer-end conservation,’ we record the first example of a viral bloom overwhelming a CRISPR system.
G05.2	crispr	2165011752	G05.2_2165011752_11	The polyclonal viruses bloom even though they share sequences previously targeted by host CRISPR loci.
G05.2	crispr	2165011752	G05.2_2165011752_12	Simulations show how increasing random genomic deletions in CRISPR loci purges immunological controls on long-lived viral sequences, allowing polyclonal viruses to bloom and depressing host fitness.
G05.2	crispr	2165011752	G05.2_2165011752_13	Our results thus link documented patterns of genomic conservation in CRISPR loci to an evolutionary advantage against persistent viruses.
G05.2	crispr	2165011752	G05.2_2165011752_14	By maintaining old immunities, selection may be tuning CRISPR-mediated immunity against viruses reemerging from lysogeny or migration.
G05.2	crispr	2470274171	G05.2_2470274171_1	Motivation: Despite the growing popularity in using CRISPR/Cas9 technology for genome editing and gene knockout, its performance still relies on well-designed single guide RNAs (sgRNA).
G05.2	crispr	2470274171	G05.2_2470274171_2	In this study, we propose a web application for the Design and Optimization (CRISPR-DO) of guide sequences that target both coding and non-coding regions in spCas9 CRISPR system across human, mouse, zebrafish, fly and worm genomes.
G05.2	crispr	2470274171	G05.2_2470274171_3	CRISPR-DO uses a computational sequence model to predict sgRNA efficiency, and employs a specificity scoring function to evaluate the potential of off-target effect.
G05.2	crispr	2470274171	G05.2_2470274171_4	It also provides information on functional conservation of target sequences, as well as the overlaps with exons, putative regulatory sequences and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
G05.2	crispr	2470274171	G05.2_2470274171_5	The web application has a user-friendly genome–browser interface to facilitate the selection of the best target DNA sequences for experimental design.

G05.2	crispr	3006861631	G05.2_3006861631_3	CRISPR-based immunity mechanism can be manipulated to perform genome editing at low cost.
G05.2	crispr	3006861631	G05.2_3006861631_4	To improve the specificity of CRISPR-based genome editing, better software and experimental tools are needed, and accurate detection of CRISPR arrays in DNA sequences is the first step toward this goal.
G05.2	crispr	3006861631	G05.2_3006861631_5	In this work, a CRISPR array detection pipeline, CRISPRLstm, is presented that leverages the power of artificial intelligence.

G05.2	crispr	2142257714	G05.2_2142257714_1	Summary: The rapid development of CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing techniques has given rise to a number of online and stand-alone tools to find and score CRISPR sites for whole genomes.
G05.2	crispr	2142257714	G05.2_2142257714_2	Here we describe the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Genome Editing database (WGE), which uses novel methods to compute, visualize and select optimal CRISPR sites in a genome browser environment.
G05.2	crispr	2142257714	G05.2_2142257714_3	The WGE database currently stores single and paired CRISPR sites and pre-calculated off-target information for CRISPRs located in the mouse and human exomes.

G05.2	crispr	2906160777	G05.2_2906160777_4	The first tool to work directly on raw sequence data is Crass, which requires that reads are long enough to contain two copies of the same repeat.
G05.2	crispr	2906160777	G05.2_2906160777_5	We developed a method to identify CRISPR repeats from a raw sequence data of short reads.
G05.2	crispr	2906160777	G05.2_2906160777_6	The algorithm is based on an observation differentiating CRISPR repeats from other types of repeats, and it involves a series of partial constructions of the overlap graph.
G05.2	crispr	2906160777	G05.2_2906160777_7	A preliminary implementation of the algorithm shows good results and detects CRISPR repeats in cases where other tools fail to do so.
G05.2	crispr	2587588342	G05.2_2587588342_1	The CRISPR–Cas systems in prokaryotes are RNA-guided immune systems that target and deactivate foreign nucleic acids.
G05.2	crispr	2587588342	G05.2_2587588342_2	A typical CRISPR–Cas system consists of a CRISPR array of repeat and spacer units, and a locus of cas genes.
G05.2	crispr	2587588342	G05.2_2587588342_3	The CRISPR and the cas locus are often located next to each other in the genomes.
G05.2	crispr	2587588342	G05.2_2587588342_4	However, there is no quantitative estimate of the co-location.
G05.2	crispr	2587588342	G05.2_2587588342_5	In addition, ad-hoc studies have shown that some non-CRISPR genomic elements contain repeat-spacer-like structures and are mistaken as CRISPRs.
G05.2	crispr	2587588342	G05.2_2587588342_6	Using available genome sequences, we observed that a significant number of genomes have isolated cas loci and/or CRISPRs.
G05.2	crispr	2587588342	G05.2_2587588342_7	We found that 11%, 22% and 28% of the type I, II and III cas loci are isolated (without CRISPRs in the same genomes at all or with CRISPRs distant in the genomes), respectively.
G05.2	crispr	2587588342	G05.2_2587588342_8	We identified a large number of genomic elements that superficially reassemble CRISPRs but don’t contain diverse spacers and have no companion cas genes.
G05.2	crispr	2587588342	G05.2_2587588342_9	We called these elements false-CRISPRs and further classified them into groups, including tandem repeats and Staphylococcus aureus repeat (STAR)-like elements.
G05.2	crispr	2587588342	G05.2_2587588342_10	This is the first systematic study to collect and characterize false-CRISPR elements.
G05.2	crispr	2587588342	G05.2_2587588342_11	We demonstrated that false-CRISPRs could be used to reduce the false annotation of CRISPRs, therefore showing them to be useful for improving the annotation of CRISPR–Cas systems.
G05.2	crispr	2135689945	G05.2_2135689945_1	Motivation: The discovery of CRISPR-Cas systems almost 20 years ago rapidly changed our perception of the bacterial and archaeal immune systems.
G05.2	crispr	2135689945	G05.2_2135689945_2	CRISPR loci consist of several repetitive DNA sequences called repeats, inter-spaced by stretches of variable length sequences called spacers.
G05.2	crispr	2135689945	G05.2_2135689945_3	This CRISPR array is transcribed and processed into multiple mature RNA species (crRNAs).
G05.2	crispr	2135689945	G05.2_2135689945_4	A single crRNA is integrated into an interference complex, together with CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins, to bind and degrade invading nucleic acids.
G05.2	crispr	2135689945	G05.2_2135689945_5	Although existing bioinformatics tools can recognize CRISPR loci by their characteristic repeat-spacer architecture, they generally output CRISPR arrays of ambiguous orientation and thus do not determine the strand from which crRNAs are processed.
G05.2	crispr	2135689945	G05.2_2135689945_6	Knowledge of the correct orientation is crucial for many tasks, including the classification of CRISPR conservation, the detection of leader regions, the identification of target sites (protospacers) on invading genetic elements and the characterization of protospacer-adjacent motifs.
G05.2	crispr	2135689945	G05.2_2135689945_7	Results: We present a fast and accurate tool to determine the crRNAencoding strand at CRISPR loci by predicting the correct orientation of repeats based on an advanced machine learning approach.
G05.2	crispr	2135689945	G05.2_2135689945_8	Both the repeat sequence and mutation information were encoded and processed by an efficient graph kernel to learn higher-order correlations.
G05.2	crispr	2135689945	G05.2_2135689945_9	The model was trained and tested on curated data comprising 44500 CRISPRs and yielded a remarkable performance of 0.95 AUC ROC (area under the curve of the receiver operator characteristic).
G05.2	crispr	2135689945	G05.2_2135689945_10	In addition, we show that accurate orientation information greatly improved detection of conserved repeat sequence families and structure motifs.
G05.2	crispr	2135689945	G05.2_2135689945_11	We integrated CRISPRstrand predictions into our CRISPRmap web server of CRISPR conservation and updated the latter to version 2.0.

G05.2	crispr	2473631707	G05.2_2473631707_6	This motivated us to design a new CRISPR target finding tool, PhytoCRISP-Ex.
G05.2	crispr	2473631707	G05.2_2473631707_7	Our software offers CRIPSR target predictions using an extended list of phytoplankton genomes and also delivers a user-friendly standalone application that can be used for any genome.
G05.2	crispr	2513235972	G05.2_2513235972_1	Motivation : The CRISPR-Cas system is an adaptive immune system in many archaea and bacteria, which provides resistance against invading genetic elements.
G05.2	crispr	2513235972	G05.2_2513235972_2	The first phase of CRISPR-Cas immunity is called adaptation, in which small DNA fragments are excised from genetic elements and are inserted into a CRISPR array generally adjacent to its so called leader sequence at one end of the array.
G05.2	crispr	2513235972	G05.2_2513235972_3	It has been shown that transcription initiation and adaptation signals of the CRISPR array are located within the leader.
G05.2	crispr	2513235972	G05.2_2513235972_4	However, apart from promoters, there is very little knowledge of sequence or structural motifs or their possible functions.
G05.2	crispr	2513235972	G05.2_2513235972_5	Leader properties have mainly been characterized through transcriptional initiation data from single organisms but large-scale characterization of leaders has remained challenging due to their low level of sequence conservation.
G05.2	crispr	2513235972	G05.2_2513235972_6	Results : We developed a method to successfully detect leader sequences by focusing on the consensus repeat of the adjacent CRISPR array and weak upstream conservation signals.
G05.2	crispr	2513235972	G05.2_2513235972_7	We applied our tool to the analysis of a comprehensive genomic database and identified several characteristic properties of leader sequences specific to archaea and bacteria, ranging from distinctive sizes to preferential indel localization.
G05.2	crispr	2513235972	G05.2_2513235972_8	CRISPRleader provides a full annotation of the CRISPR array, its strand orientation as well as conserved core leader boundaries that can be uploaded to any genome browser.

G05.2	crispr	2153355254	G05.2_2153355254_1	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) are a family of DNA direct repeats found in many prokaryotic genomes.
G05.2	crispr	2153355254	G05.2_2153355254_2	Repeats of 21–37 bp typically show weak dyad symmetry and are separated by regularly sized, nonrepetitive spacer sequences.
G05.2	crispr	2153355254	G05.2_2153355254_3	Four CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein families, designated Cas1 to Cas4, are strictly associated with CRISPR elements and always occur near a repeat cluster.
G05.2	crispr	2153355254	G05.2_2153355254_4	Some spacers originate from mobile genetic elements and are thought to confer “immunity” against the elements that harbor these sequences.
G05.2	crispr	2153355254	G05.2_2153355254_5	In the present study, we have systematically investigated uncharacterized proteins encoded in the vicinity of these CRISPRs and found many additional protein families that are strictly associated with CRISPR loci across multiple prokaryotic species.
G05.2	crispr	2153355254	G05.2_2153355254_6	Multiple sequence alignments and hidden Markov models have been built for 45 Cas protein families.
G05.2	crispr	2153355254	G05.2_2153355254_7	These models identify family members with high sensitivity and selectivity and classify key regulators of development, DevR and DevS, in Myxococcus xanthus as Cas proteins.
G05.2	crispr	2153355254	G05.2_2153355254_8	These identifications show that CRISPR/cas gene regions can be quite large, with up to 20 different, tandem-arranged cas genes next to a repeat cluster or filling the region between two repeat clusters.
G05.2	crispr	2153355254	G05.2_2153355254_9	Distinctive subsets of the collection of Cas proteins recur in phylogenetically distant species and correlate with characteristic repeat periodicity.
G05.2	crispr	2153355254	G05.2_2153355254_10	The analyses presented here support initial proposals of mobility of these units, along with the likelihood that loci of different subtypes interact with one another as well as with host cell defensive, replicative, and regulatory systems.
G05.2	crispr	2153355254	G05.2_2153355254_11	It is evident from this analysis that CRISPR/cas loci are larger, more complex, and more heterogeneous than previously appreciated.

G07.2	conspiracy theories	2883309640	G07.2_2883309640_3	These trends can be understood in the context of previous work on conspiracy theories, including the “just asking questions” style of rhetoric, the importance of sourcing and authority, and the tendency to simultaneously consider many different potential conspiracies that might underlie an important topic or event.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2962613545	G07.2_2962613545_1	Drawing on social-psychological and political research, we offer a theoretical model that explains how people become exposed to fake news, come to believe in them and then share them with their contacts.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2962613545	G07.2_2962613545_2	Using two waves of a nationally representative sample of Chileans with internet access, we pinpoint the relevant causal factors.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2962613545	G07.2_2962613545_3	Analysis of the panel data indicate that three groups of variables largely explain these phenomena: (1) Personal and psychological factors such as belief in conspiracy theories, trust in others, education and gender; (2) Frequency and specific uses of social media; and (3) Political views and online activism.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2962613545	G07.2_2962613545_4	Importantly, personal and political-psychological factors are more relevant in explaining this behavior than specific uses of social media.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2953000449	G07.2_2953000449_1	Despite the enthusiastic rhetoric about the so called \emph{collective intelligence}, conspiracy theories -- e.g.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2953000449	G07.2_2953000449_2	global warming induced by chemtrails or the link between vaccines and autism -- find on the Web a natural medium for their dissemination.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2953000449	G07.2_2953000449_3	Users preferentially consume information according to their system of beliefs and the strife within users of opposite narratives may result in heated debates.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2953000449	G07.2_2953000449_4	In this work we provide a genuine example of information consumption from a sample of 1.2 million of Facebook Italian users.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2953000449	G07.2_2953000449_5	We show by means of a thorough quantitative analysis that information supporting different worldviews -- i.e.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2953000449	G07.2_2953000449_6	scientific and conspiracist news -- are consumed in a comparable way by their respective users.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2953000449	G07.2_2953000449_7	Moreover, we measure the effect of the exposure to 4709 evidently false information (satirical version of conspiracy theses) and to 4502 debunking memes (information aiming at contrasting unsubstantiated rumors) of the most polarized users of conspiracy claims.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2953000449	G07.2_2953000449_8	We find that either contrasting or teasing consumers of conspiracy narratives increases their probability to interact again with unsubstantiated rumors.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2952517423	G07.2_2952517423_1	Online social media, periodically serves as a platform for cascading polarizing topics of conversation.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2952517423	G07.2_2952517423_2	"The inherent community structure present in online social networks (homophily) and the advent of fringe outlets like Gab have created online ""echo chambers"" that amplify the effects of polarization, which fuels detrimental behavior."
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2952517423	G07.2_2952517423_3	Recently, in October 2018, Gab made headlines when it was revealed that Robert Bowers, the individual behind the Pittsburgh Synagogue massacre, was an active member of this social media site and used it to express his anti-Semitic views and discuss conspiracy theories.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2952517423	G07.2_2952517423_4	Thus to address the need of automated data-driven analyses of such fringe outlets, this research proposes novel methods to discover topics that are prevalent in Gab and how they cascade within the network.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2952517423	G07.2_2952517423_5	"Specifically, using approximately 34 million posts, and 3.7 million cascading conversation threads with close to 300k users; we demonstrate that there are essentially five cascading patterns that manifest in Gab and the most ""viral"" ones begin with an echo-chamber pattern and grow out to the entire network."
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2952517423	G07.2_2952517423_6	Also, we empirically show, through two models viz.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2952517423	G07.2_2952517423_7	Susceptible-Infected and Bass, how the cascades structurally evolve from one of the five patterns to the other based on the topic of the conversation with upto 84% accuracy.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2949861795	G07.2_2949861795_1	Given the huge impact that Online Social Networks (OSN) had in the way people get informed and form their opinion, they became an attractive playground for malicious entities that want to spread misinformation, and leverage their effect.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2949861795	G07.2_2949861795_2	"In fact, misinformation easily spreads on OSN and is a huge threat for modern society, possibly influencing also the outcome of elections, or even putting peopleu0027s life at risk (e.g., spreading ""anti-vaccines"" misinformation)."
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2949861795	G07.2_2949861795_3	"Therefore, it is of paramount importance for our society to have some sort of ""validation"" on information spreading through OSN."
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2949861795	G07.2_2949861795_4	The need for a wide-scale validation would greatly benefit from automatic tools.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2949861795	G07.2_2949861795_5	":[102],""this paper, we show that it is difficult to carry out an automatic classification of misinformation considering only structural properties of content propagation cascades."
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2949861795	G07.2_2949861795_6	We focus on structural properties, because they would be inherently difficult to be manipulated, with the the aim of circumventing classification systems.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2949861795	G07.2_2949861795_7	To support our claim, we carry out an extensive evaluation on Facebook posts belonging to conspiracy theories (as representative of misinformation), and scientific news (representative of fact-checked content).
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2949861795	G07.2_2949861795_8	Our findings show that conspiracy content actually reverberates in a way which is hard to distinguish from the one scientific content does: for the classification mechanisms we investigated, classification F1-score never exceeds 0.65 during content propagation stages, and is still less than 0.7 even after propagation is complete.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2945924652	G07.2_2945924652_7	In this paper, we try to shine a light into this phenomenon and its extent, in order to start a conversation within the Wikipedia community about transparent processes for assigning political orientation and journalistic reliability labels to news sources, especially to unfamiliar ones, which users would be more likely to verify by looking them up.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2945924652	G07.2_2945924652_8	As more of Wikipedia’s content is used outside Wikipedia’s “container” (e.g., in search results or by voice personal assistants), the issue of where certain statements appear in the Wikipedia page and their verifiability becomes an urgent one to consider not only by Wikipedia editors, but by third-party information providers too.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2060613652	G10.1_2060613652_1	In this paper, we present an integrated approach for robot localization, obstacle mapping, and path planning in 3D environments based on data of an onboard consumer-level depth camera.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2060613652	G10.1_2060613652_2	We rely on state-of-the-art techniques for environment modeling and localization, which we extend for depth camera data.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2060613652	G10.1_2060613652_3	We thoroughly evaluated our system with a Nao humanoid equipped with an Asus Xtion Pro Live depth camera on top of the humanoidu0027s head and present navigation experiments in a multi-level environment containing static and non-static obstacles.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2060613652	G10.1_2060613652_4	Our approach performs in real-time, maintains a 3D environment representation, and estimates the robotu0027s pose in 6D.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2060613652	G10.1_2060613652_5	As our results demonstrate, the depth camera is well-suited for robust localization and reliable obstacle avoidance in complex indoor environments.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2117547109	G10.1_2117547109_1	In this paper, we consider the problem of building 3D models of complex staircases based on laser range data acquired with a humanoid.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2117547109	G10.1_2117547109_2	These models have to be sufficiently accurate to enable the robot to reliably climb up the staircase.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2117547109	G10.1_2117547109_3	We evaluate two state-of-the-art approaches to plane segmentation for humanoid navigation given 3D range data about the environment.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2117547109	G10.1_2117547109_4	The first approach initially extracts line segments from neighboring 2D scan lines, which are successively combined if they lie on the same plane.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2117547109	G10.1_2117547109_5	The second approach estimates the main directions in the environment by randomly sampling points and applying a clustering technique afterwards to find planes orthogonal to the main directions.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2117547109	G10.1_2117547109_6	We propose extensions for this basic approach to increase the robustness in complex environments which may contain a large number of different planes and clutter.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2117547109	G10.1_2117547109_7	In practical experiments, we thoroughly evaluate all methods using data acquired with a laser-equipped Nao robot in a multi-level environment.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2117547109	G10.1_2117547109_8	As the experimental results show, the reconstructed 3D models can be used to autonomously climb up complex staircases.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2767615925	G10.1_2767615925_1	Modern approaches to mobile robot navigation typically employ a two-tiered system where first a geometric path is computed in a potentially obstacle-laden environment, and then a reactive motion controller with obstacle-avoidance capabilities is used to follow this path to the goal.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2767615925	G10.1_2767615925_2	However, when multiple path candidates are present, the shortest path is not always the best choice as it may lead through narrow gaps and it may be in general hard to follow due to a lack of smoothness.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2767615925	G10.1_2767615925_3	The assessment of an estimated completion time is a much stronger selection criterion, but due to the lack of a dynamic model in the path computation phase the completion time is typically a priori not known.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2767615925	G10.1_2767615925_4	We introduce a novel approach to estimate the completion time of a path based on simple, readily available features such as the length, the smoothness, and the clearance of the path.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2767615925	G10.1_2767615925_5	To this end, we apply non-linear regression and train an estimator with data gained from the simulation of the actual path execution with a controller that is based on the well-known Dynamic Window Approach.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2767615925	G10.1_2767615925_6	As we show in the experiments, our method is able to realistically estimate the completion time for 2D grid paths using the learned predictor and highly outperforms a prediction that is only based on path length.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2910440137	G10.1_2910440137_1	With the advent of polygonal maps finding their way into the navigational software of mobile robots, the Visibility Graph can be used to search for the shortest collision-free path.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2910440137	G10.1_2910440137_2	The nature of the Visibility Graph-based shortest path algorithms is such that first the entire graph is computed in a relatively time-consuming manner.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2910440137	G10.1_2910440137_3	Then, the graph can be searched efficiently any number of times for varying start and target state combinations with the A* or the Dijkstra algorithm.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2910440137	G10.1_2910440137_4	However, real-world environments are typically too dynamic for a map to remain valid for a long time.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2910440137	G10.1_2910440137_5	With the goal of obtaining the shortest path quickly in an ever changing environment, we introduce a rapid path finding algorithm-Minimal Construct-that discovers only a necessary portion of the Visibility Graph around the obstacles that actually get in the way.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2910440137	G10.1_2910440137_6	Collision tests are computed only for lines that seem heuristically promising.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2910440137	G10.1_2910440137_7	This way, shortest paths can be found much faster than with a state-of-the-art Visibility Graph algorithm and as our experiments show, even grid-based A* searches are outperformed in most cases with the added benefit of smoother and shorter paths.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1983203459	G10.1_1983203459_1	We present a system that enables a humanoid robot to imitate complex whole-body motions of humans in real time.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1983203459	G10.1_1983203459_2	For recording the human motions, any sensor system capable of inferring the joint angle trajectories can be used.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1983203459	G10.1_1983203459_3	In our work, we capture the human data with an Xsens MVN motion capture system consisting of inertial sensors attached to the body.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1983203459	G10.1_1983203459_4	Our framework converts the human joint angles to the robotu0027s joint angles in real time.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1983203459	G10.1_1983203459_5	Here, we use a mapping between the humanu0027s and the robotu0027s joints to ensure feasibility of the motion.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1983203459	G10.1_1983203459_6	The focus of our system lies in ensuring static stability when the motions are executed which is a challenging task, depending on the complexity of the movements.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1983203459	G10.1_1983203459_7	To avoid falls of the robot that might occur when using direct imitation of the joint angle trajectories due to the different weight distribution, we developed an approach that actively balances the center of mass over the support polygon of the robotu0027s feet.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1983203459	G10.1_1983203459_8	At every point in time, our approach ensures that the robot is in a statically stable configuration, i.e., that the ground projection of the center of mass lies within the convex hull of the foot contact points.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1983203459	G10.1_1983203459_9	To achieve this, we apply inverse kinematics given valid foot positions that satisfy the stability criterion and generate the corresponding leg joint angles.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1983203459	G10.1_1983203459_10	In more detail, our system first finds valid positions for the robotu0027s feet by determining a target plane and its orientation, so that the feet can be placed planar and the robotu0027s center of mass is over the support polygon.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1983203459	G10.1_1983203459_11	The new positions of the feet are chosen as the projection on the target plane.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1983203459	G10.1_1983203459_12	Afterwards, the corresponding leg joint angles are calculated via inverse kinematics.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1983203459	G10.1_1983203459_13	To determine whether the configuration is in the double support modus, and if not, which foot is the stance foot, we evaluate the position of the center of mass relative to the feet.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1983203459	G10.1_1983203459_14	As can be seen in the experiments with a Nao humanoid, our approach leads to a highly stable imitation of challenging human movements (see also Fig.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1983203459	G10.1_1983203459_15	1).
G10.1	humanoid robots	1983203459	G10.1_1983203459_16	In contrast to recent approaches that capture human data using a Kinect-like sensor and only imitate arm movements while keeping the body static, our system can deal with complex, whole-body motions.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1983203459	G10.1_1983203459_17	Note that our approach does not require a prior learning phase but computes stable configurations online and almost in real time as can be seen in the accompanying video.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1983203459	G10.1_1983203459_18	We are currently working on imitating motions to learn complex navigation actions such as climbing up staircases or walking down ramps.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1983203459	G10.1_1983203459_19	Our system can also be used for tele-operated tasks that include whole-body movements where stability needs to be guaranteed in order to successfully fulfill the mission.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2912816339	G10.1_2912816339_1	Abstract The ability of mobile service robots to efficiently search for a person is needed in a vast domain of applications.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2912816339	G10.1_2912816339_2	The search problem is especially challenging when the user is freely moving across the environment, the robot has only a constrained field of view, and visibility constraints arise from the environment.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2912816339	G10.1_2912816339_3	We propose in this article a novel approach that simulates the userâ€™s presence at different locations in the environment based on a hidden Markov modelÂ (HMM).
G10.1	humanoid robots	2912816339	G10.1_2912816339_4	The HMM predicts the userâ€™s motion and computes the observability likelihood at the different locations given the predictions.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2912816339	G10.1_2912816339_5	Our approach then selects effective search locations that maximize the userâ€™s expected observability.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2912816339	G10.1_2912816339_6	The selection criterion hereby considers the visibility constraints along the robotâ€™s path as well as the robotâ€™s travel time to reach the search location.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2912816339	G10.1_2912816339_7	We performed both real-world and extensive simulated experiments to evaluate our method.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2912816339	G10.1_2912816339_8	In comparison to a greedy maximum coverage approach as well as to a greedy strategy that uses background information, we show that our framework leads to a significant reduction of the time needed to find the user.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2771327140	G10.1_2771327140_1	We present a simple and efficient mathematical framework suitable for generating motion in the context of a variety of robotic motion tasks ranging from low-level motor control up to high-level locomotion planning.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2771327140	G10.1_2771327140_2	Our concept is based on a one-dimensional second-order model that allows analytic computation of its inverse dynamics while respecting physical constraints.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2771327140	G10.1_2771327140_3	This makes it a particularly useful tool for tasks that are expressed only as a start and goal state, such as animation key frames or way points in path planning.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2771327140	G10.1_2771327140_4	By means of time synchronization, the model extends easily to an arbitrary number of dimensions in a way that the target is reached in all dimensions at the same time.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2771327140	G10.1_2771327140_5	The framework excels in terms of execution time, which lies in the microsecond range even for high-dimensional trajectory generation tasks.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2771327140	G10.1_2771327140_6	We demonstrate our method in two different settings â€” full-body trajectory generation and path planning â€” and show its benefits in comparison with current state-of-the-art algorithms.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2010209632	G10.1_2010209632_1	Humanoid service robots performing complex object manipulation tasks need to plan whole-body motions that satisfy a variety of constraints: The robot must keep its balance, self-collisions and collisions with obstacles in the environment must be avoided and, if applicable, the trajectory of the end-effector must follow the constrained motion of a manipulated object in Cartesian space.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2010209632	G10.1_2010209632_2	These constraints and the high number of degrees of freedom make whole-body motion planning for humanoids a challenging problem.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2010209632	G10.1_2010209632_3	In this paper, we present an approach to whole-body motion planning with a focus on the manipulation of articulated objects such as doors and drawers.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2010209632	G10.1_2010209632_4	Our approach is based on rapidly-exploring random trees in combination with inverse kinematics and considers all required constraints during the search.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2010209632	G10.1_2010209632_5	Models of articulated objects hereby generate hand poses for sampled configurations along the trajectory of the object handle.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2010209632	G10.1_2010209632_6	We thoroughly evaluated our planning system and present experiments with a Nao humanoid opening a drawer, a door, and picking up an object.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2010209632	G10.1_2010209632_7	The experiments demonstrate the ability of our framework to generate solutions to complex planning problems and furthermore show that these plans can be reliably executed even on a low-cost humanoid platform.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1654769343	G10.1_1654769343_1	This paper aims to review the ASKNAO apps targeting at social skills of children with autism.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1654769343	G10.1_1654769343_2	The ASKNAO Apps is a system that designed to teach children with autism the basic skills that are naturally learned by the typical children.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1654769343	G10.1_1654769343_3	Since ASKNAO apps is a commercial based system, the contents are yet to be categorized technically and specifically in accordance to the three autism criteria which are social skills, communication skills and repetitive behavior.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1654769343	G10.1_1654769343_4	By taking the first step in identifying the Apps suitability focusing on social skills, further study on application and assessment of ASKNAO can be conducted to teach the child in the direction of the useru0027s requirements.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2084959384	G10.1_2084959384_1	Efficient footstep planning for humanoid navigation through cluttered environments is still a challenging problem.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2084959384	G10.1_2084959384_2	Many obstacles create local minima in the search space, forcing heuristic planners such as A* to expand large areas.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2084959384	G10.1_2084959384_3	The goal of this work is to efficiently compute long, feasible footstep paths.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2084959384	G10.1_2084959384_4	For navigation, finding the optimal path initially is often not needed as it can be improved while walking.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2084959384	G10.1_2084959384_5	Thus, we propose anytime search-based planning using the anytime repairing A* (ARA*) and randomized A* (R*) planners.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2084959384	G10.1_2084959384_6	This allows to obtain efficient paths with provable suboptimality within short planning times.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2084959384	G10.1_2084959384_7	Opposed to completely randomized methods such as rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs), these planners create paths that are goal-directed and guaranteed to be no more than a certain factor longer than the optimal solution.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2084959384	G10.1_2084959384_8	We thoroughly evaluated the planners in various scenarios using different heuristics.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2084959384	G10.1_2084959384_9	ARA* with the 2D Dijkstra heuristic yields fast and efficient solutions but its potential inadmissibility results in non-optimal paths for some scenarios.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2084959384	G10.1_2084959384_10	R*, on the other hand borrows ideas from RRTs, yields fast solutions, and is less dependent on a well-designed heuristic function.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2084959384	G10.1_2084959384_11	This allows it to avoid local minima and reduces the number of expanded states.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2311600036	G10.1_2311600036_1	This paper is, we used a humanoid robot to physically show emotional poses and conduct a simple guessing game with children.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2311600036	G10.1_2311600036_2	Nine different emotions using the robotu0027s body poses have been developed using Choregraphe.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2311600036	G10.1_2311600036_3	Naturally, we need to approximate as closely as possible natural human behaviour to be done by robot to engaging the children to interact with normal human.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2311600036	G10.1_2311600036_4	Therefore, this study is continuation of our previous study on emotion gestures where we get the therapists response towards module of emotions-based teaching module for children with autism.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2311600036	G10.1_2311600036_5	The role of therapists is to give their main knowledge of autism therapy to bring the right creation of module program using robot.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2543043356	G10.1_2543043356_1	Robotic soccer superseded chess as a challenge problem and benchmark for artificial intelligence research and poses many challenges for robotics.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2543043356	G10.1_2543043356_2	The international RoboCup championships grew to the most important robotic competition worldwide.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2543043356	G10.1_2543043356_3	This paper describes the mechanical and electrical design of the robots that we constructed for RoboCup 2006, which took place in Bremen, Germany.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2543043356	G10.1_2543043356_4	The paper also covers the software used for perception, behavior control, communication, and simulation.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2543043356	G10.1_2543043356_5	Our robots performed well.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2543043356	G10.1_2543043356_6	The KidSize robots won the Penalty Kick competition and came in second the overall Best Humanoid ranking, next only to the titleholder, Team Osaka.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2309412561	G10.1_2309412561_1	This project presents a new approach of humanoid-operated mobile platform.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2309412561	G10.1_2309412561_2	The robot used in this work is Nao by Aldebaran Robotics.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2309412561	G10.1_2309412561_3	Nao is chosen because of its versatility.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2309412561	G10.1_2309412561_4	Its wide range of movements allows it to perform various tasks such as steering through a simple programming algorithm.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2309412561	G10.1_2309412561_5	Arduino microcontroller target board is used to provide the interface between Nao robot and the mobile platform.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2309412561	G10.1_2309412561_6	This project consist of several parts.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2309412561	G10.1_2309412561_7	This study will focuses on the development of mobile platform, integration of Arduino microcontroller programming with Naou0027s Choregraphe, navigation with obstacle avoidance and finally navigation with human following ability by implementing Nao Mark visual tracking.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2047186501	G10.1_2047186501_1	Robots present immense potential as adjunct therapeutic tool, particularly for children with autism.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2047186501	G10.1_2047186501_2	Autism is a developmental disability normally detected within the first 3 years of life, characterized by the differing degrees of impairments in stereotyped behavior, social interaction and communication.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2047186501	G10.1_2047186501_3	This paper highlights our findings in a pilot study where children with autism were exposed to a humanoid robot.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2047186501	G10.1_2047186501_4	The simple modules of interaction were designed based on the human-robot interaction (HRI) approach.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2047186501	G10.1_2047186501_5	Six children who participated were identified with lower IQ classification.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2047186501	G10.1_2047186501_6	Child-robot interaction session and the childrenu0027s interaction behavior in class (without robot) were recorded.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2047186501	G10.1_2047186501_7	A behavior score sheet referenced to GARS-2 was used to evaluate the videos in both set-ups.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2047186501	G10.1_2047186501_8	Initial responses of the children were analyzed specifically in the deficit area of stereotyped behavior.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2047186501	G10.1_2047186501_9	Overall results show that 5 out of the 6 children responded well in child-robot interaction.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2047186501	G10.1_2047186501_10	Comparison with in-class interaction portrays reduced percentage in stereotyped behavior during the child-robot interaction.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2047186501	G10.1_2047186501_11	However, strong proof to link the childrenu0027s responses with their IQ levels need to be supported with larger samples of children in the future.
G10.1	humanoid robots	3005094453	G10.1_3005094453_1	Teleoperation is still the de-facto mode of operation for robotic manipulators in hazardous and unknown environments.
G10.1	humanoid robots	3005094453	G10.1_3005094453_2	The objective is to move the manipulator under the influence of a plenitude of constraints, mainly following the human operatoru0027s commands, but also the avoidance of adverse effects such as joint limits or the exertion of external forces.
G10.1	humanoid robots	3005094453	G10.1_3005094453_3	A classic approach to incorporate such non-instantaneous behavior into the instantaneous motion of the kinematic chain is the Closed-Loop Inverse Kinematics (CLIK) control scheme.
G10.1	humanoid robots	3005094453	G10.1_3005094453_4	In this paper, we present PV-CLIK, a novel CLIK realization that for the first time practically applies the Popov-Vereshchagin (PV) hybrid dynamics solver to map the instantaneous constraints to motion commands.
G10.1	humanoid robots	3005094453	G10.1_3005094453_5	By relying on the PV solver, PV-CLIK offers several benefits over traditional CLIK implementations such as linear runtime complexity, handling constraints on the dynamics level or fostering composable software architectures.
G10.1	humanoid robots	3005094453	G10.1_3005094453_6	In the experimental evaluation, we show that our implementation of PV-CLIK outperforms existing kinematics solvers in Cartesian trajectory-following tasks at high velocities.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2087627746	G10.1_2087627746_1	Collision-free navigation in cluttered environments is essential for any mobile manipulation system.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2087627746	G10.1_2087627746_2	Traditional navigation systems have relied on a 2D grid map projected from a 3D representation for efficiency.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2087627746	G10.1_2087627746_3	This approach, however, prevents navigation close to objects in situations where projected 3D configurations are in collision within the 2D grid map even if actually no collision occurs in the 3D environment.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2087627746	G10.1_2087627746_4	Accordingly, when using such a 2D representation for planning paths of a mobile manipulation robot, the number of planning problems which can be solved is limited and suboptimal robot paths may result.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2087627746	G10.1_2087627746_5	We present a fast, integrated approach to solve path planning in 3D using a combination of an efficient octree-based representation of the 3D world and an anytime search-based motion planner.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2087627746	G10.1_2087627746_6	Our approach utilizes a combination of multi-layered 2D and 3D representations to improve planning speed, allowing the generation of almost real-time plans with bounded sub-optimality.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2087627746	G10.1_2087627746_7	We present extensive experimental results with the two-armed mobile manipulation robot PR2 carrying large objects in a highly cluttered environment.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2087627746	G10.1_2087627746_8	Using our approach, the robot is able to efficiently plan and execute trajectories while transporting objects, thereby often moving through demanding, narrow passageways.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2039999857	G10.1_2039999857_1	This paper presents a method to carry out qualitative analysis when evaluating the interaction between child and robot in autism intervention.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2039999857	G10.1_2039999857_2	The technique consists of 24-items of behavioral assessment which was referenced to the Gilliam Autism Rating Scale-Second Edition (GARS-2).
G10.1	humanoid robots	2039999857	G10.1_2039999857_3	GARS-2 is a screening instrument used to identify and diagnose autism.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2039999857	G10.1_2039999857_4	Preliminary results from a pilot study show that this method had allowed qualitative observation to be carried out to compare the behavior of autistic children with and without the presence of a robot.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2039999857	G10.1_2039999857_5	The feasibility of this technique will be further justified through future wide-spread studies involving a larger number of children spanning across the whole spectrum of autism.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2003799949	G10.1_2003799949_1	In this paper, we propose a face recognition method for tracking, detecting and recognizing the faces of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) for robotic assistive therapy application.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2003799949	G10.1_2003799949_2	ASD is a brain developmental disorder that manifests itself through a personu0027s behavior and social-communication skill [1].
G10.1	humanoid robots	2003799949	G10.1_2003799949_3	Face recognition stage is an essential element in robotic assistive therapy since it is the first interaction step that occurs between autistic children and robot.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2003799949	G10.1_2003799949_4	The algorithm aims to encourage autistic children to interact and to capture their attention using a robot that recognizes their faces.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2003799949	G10.1_2003799949_5	This is to establish a beneficial training environment for autistic children before engaging further in the training module.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1972906865	G10.1_1972906865_1	In this paper, we used a humanoid robot to physically show emotional poses and conduct a simple guessing game with children.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1972906865	G10.1_1972906865_2	Nine different emotions using the robotu0027s body poses have been developed using Choregraphe.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1972906865	G10.1_1972906865_3	A pre-test was carried out with a normal developing 6-year old boy.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1972906865	G10.1_1972906865_4	We report some qualitative findings that we found during the child-robot interaction.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1972906865	G10.1_1972906865_5	We aim to develop an Android app as a simple tool that can be used on smartphones.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1972906865	G10.1_1972906865_6	This serves as a fundamental step to empower non-technical persons in using robots to interact with children with autism for learning and therapeutic purposes.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2139842906	G10.1_2139842906_1	In this study we explored basic dimensions used to perceive humanoid robots and developed a scale to evaluate perception of humanoid robots, PERNOD.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2139842906	G10.1_2139842906_2	Previous studies of perception of humanoid robots used psychological scales created for interpersonal perception between humans.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2139842906	G10.1_2139842906_3	This study clarified the basic dimensions of perception of humanoid robots and developed PERNOD by means of psychological methodology.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2139842906	G10.1_2139842906_4	The results revealed six basic dimensions of perception of humanoid robots: Utility, Clumsiness of motion, Possibility of communication, Controllability, Vulnerability, and Objective hardness.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2139842906	G10.1_2139842906_5	The 6 dimensions of PERNOD were originally developed for humanoid robots.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2139842906	G10.1_2139842906_6	Thus, these dimensions represent the organization of knowledge used in the recognition of humanoid robots.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2139842906	G10.1_2139842906_7	Usability of PERNOD was discussed.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2102859583	G10.1_2102859583_1	Many types of mobile humanoid robots combining both the characteristics of mobile robot and humanoid robot have been developed in the literatures in the past two decades.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2102859583	G10.1_2102859583_2	This paper is aimed at presenting a survey of robotic structures for the mobile humanoid robots.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2102859583	G10.1_2102859583_3	The most used ones are wheeled mobile humanoid robots with their salient features of the human-like upper body normally containing two arms, the waist, neck and head mounted on a wheeled mobile platform.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2102859583	G10.1_2102859583_4	The whole-body structure and different parts are all analyzed in detail by comparing among similar mobile humanoid robots.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2102859583	G10.1_2102859583_5	This work will be meaningful for the design of future promising mobile humanoid robots.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2116900206	G10.1_2116900206_1	This research presents the validation study of a qualitative tool to analyze the response in robot-based intervention.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2116900206	G10.1_2116900206_2	The 24 behavioral items in the tool were determined through routine observations carried out by clinicians and the definitions of autism adopted by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: Fourth Edition-Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR).
G10.1	humanoid robots	2116900206	G10.1_2116900206_3	34 experts determined content validity and tool reliability by viewpoints through the Likert scale.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2116900206	G10.1_2116900206_4	The tool was found to have good content validity with more than 67% of experts scored at least 3 on the 5-point Likert scale.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2116900206	G10.1_2116900206_5	Cronbachu0027s alpha coefficient of 0.872 reflected the toolu0027s content reliability and internal consistency.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2116900206	G10.1_2116900206_6	The tool was used to analyze the behavior response of children with autism when exposed to a humanoid robot.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2116900206	G10.1_2116900206_7	It functioned as a score-sheet to compare the behavior of autistic children with and without the presence of a robot.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2116900206	G10.1_2116900206_8	These findings put forward a tool with contents considered valid to evaluate behavior outcome of studies involving children with autism and robots.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1587415549	G10.1_1587415549_1	This paper reports findings from an open-ended survey on attitudes towards humanoid robots collected from samples in the United Kingdom and Japan.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1587415549	G10.1_1587415549_2	335 participants were asked how they felt about humanoid robots becoming widespread in society and what tasks they wanted humanoid robots to perform.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1587415549	G10.1_1587415549_3	While the UK sample was overall less negative towards humanoid robots than their Japanese counterparts, the UK sample did not want robots to perform tasks that required capabilities deemed as human qualities, such as empathy, caring, or independent decision making.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2566610034	G10.1_2566610034_1	Standing up after falling is an essential ability for humanoid robots in order to resume their tasks without help from humans.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2566610034	G10.1_2566610034_2	Although many humanoid robots, especially small-size humanoid robots, have their own stand-up motions, there has not been a generalized method to automatically learn flexible stand-up motions for humanoid robots which can be applied to various fallen positions.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2566610034	G10.1_2566610034_3	In this research, we propose a method for learning stand-up motions for humanoid robots using Q-learning making use of their bilateral symmetry.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2566610034	G10.1_2566610034_4	We implemented this method on DarwIn-OP humanoid robots and learned an optimal policy in simulation.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2566610034	G10.1_2566610034_5	We compared the resulting stand-up motion with manually designed stand-up motions and with stand-up motions learned without considering bilateral symmetry.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2566610034	G10.1_2566610034_6	Both in simulation and on the real robot, the new stand-up motion was successful in most trials while other motions took longer or were not as robust.

G01.1	Digital assistant	2921394285	G01.1_2921394285_1	This paper presents novel attacks on voice-controlled digital assistants using nonsensical word sequences.
G01.1	Digital assistant	2921394285	G01.1_2921394285_2	We present the results of a small-scale experiment which demonstrates that it is possible for malicious actors to gain covert access to a voice-controlled system by hiding commands in apparently nonsensical sounds of which the meaning is opaque to humans.
G01.1	Digital assistant	2921394285	G01.1_2921394285_3	Several instances of nonsensical word sequences were identified which triggered a target command in a voice-controlled digital assistant, but which were incomprehensible to humans, as shown in tests with human experimental subjects.
G01.1	Digital assistant	2921394285	G01.1_2921394285_4	Our work confirms the potential for hiding malicious voice commands to voice-controlled digital assistants or other speech-controlled devices in speech sounds which are perceived by humans as nonsensical.
G01.1	Digital assistant	2921394285	G01.1_2921394285_5	This paper also develops a novel attack concept which involves gaining unauthorised access to a voice-controlled system using apparently unrelated utterances.
G01.1	Digital assistant	2921394285	G01.1_2921394285_6	We present the results of a proof-of-concept study showing that it is possible to trigger actions in a voice-controlled digital assistant using utterances which are accepted by the system as a target command despite having a different meaning to the command in terms of human understanding.
G01.1	Digital assistant	2894404632	G01.1_2894404632_1	Digital assistant technologies are becoming increasingly common at home.
G01.1	Digital assistant	2894404632	G01.1_2894404632_2	These technologies also hold high potential through supporting individuals at work.
G01.1	Digital assistant	2894404632	G01.1_2894404632_3	However, it remains a challenge for research to understand which psychological features should be embodied by digital assistant technologies so that they can become meaningful everyday companions and contribute to useru0027s wellbeing.
G01.1	Digital assistant	2894404632	G01.1_2894404632_4	In this work, we conducted a focus group, a survey and an expert workshop to investigate user perceptions of digital assistants and explore how interactive technologies can be perceived as companions.
G01.1	Digital assistant	2894404632	G01.1_2894404632_5	We found that the design space of digital companions can be described as a spectrum between passive and active assistance.
G01.1	Digital assistant	2894404632	G01.1_2894404632_6	Further, users reported that assistant technologies can assume different roles (e.g.
G01.1	Digital assistant	2894404632	G01.1_2894404632_7	friend, advisor) connected to the task performed.
G01.1	Digital assistant	2894404632	G01.1_2894404632_8	Our findings contribute initial insights regarding psychological qualities of digital companions and highlight a number of important questions for future research.
G01.1	Digital assistant	2113733134	G01.1_2113733134_1	Operating robots in an outdoor setting poses interesting problems in terms of interaction.
G01.1	Digital assistant	2113733134	G01.1_2113733134_2	To interact with the robot there is a need for a flexible computer interface.
G01.1	Digital assistant	2113733134	G01.1_2113733134_3	In this paper a PDA-based (personal digital assistant, i.e.
G01.1	Digital assistant	2113733134	G01.1_2113733134_4	a handheld computer) approach to robot interaction is presented.
G01.1	Digital assistant	2113733134	G01.1_2113733134_5	The system is designed to allow non-expert users to utilise the robot for operation in an urban exploration setup.

G02.2	privacy	2401742410	G02.2_2401742410_1	Smartphones, the devices we carry everywhere with us, are being heavily tracked and have undoubtedly become a major threat to our privacy.
G02.2	privacy	2401742410	G02.2_2401742410_2	"As "" Tracking the trackers "" has become a necessity, various static and dynamic analysis tools have been developed in the past."
G02.2	privacy	2401742410	G02.2_2401742410_3	However, today, we still lack suitable tools to detect, measure and compare the ongoing tracking across mobile OSs.
G02.2	privacy	2401742410	G02.2_2401742410_4	To this end, we propose MobileAppScrutinator, based on a simple yet efficient dynamic analysis approach, that works on both Android and iOS (the two most popular OSs today).
G02.2	privacy	2401742410	G02.2_2401742410_5	To demonstrate the current trend in tracking, we select 140 most representative Apps available on both Android and iOS AppStores and test them with MobileAppScrutinator.
G02.2	privacy	2401742410	G02.2_2401742410_6	In fact, choosing the same set of apps on both Android and iOS also enables us to compare the ongoing tracking on these two OSs.
G02.2	privacy	2401742410	G02.2_2401742410_7	Finally, we also discuss the effectiveness of privacy safeguards available on Android and iOS.
G02.2	privacy	2401742410	G02.2_2401742410_8	We show that neither Android nor iOS privacy safeguards in their present state are completely satisfying.
G02.2	privacy	2907544410	G02.2_2907544410_1	Mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets have become increasingly popular tools for Internet-based communication such as web browsing and text messaging.
G02.2	privacy	2907544410	G02.2_2907544410_2	At the same time however, mobile devices fail to provide important privacy guarantees for their users.
G02.2	privacy	2907544410	G02.2_2907544410_3	In particular, mobile devices per default neither conceal which services they are contacting nor hide their source IP addresses.
G02.2	privacy	2907544410	G02.2_2907544410_4	Solutions to these problems exist, but either do not provide sufficient protection or have not gained widespread use due to a lack of usability.
G02.2	privacy	2907544410	G02.2_2907544410_5	In this paper, we therefore present an architecture that combines the transparent tunneling of traffic with the strong protection of low-latency anonymisation networks.
G02.2	privacy	2907544410	G02.2_2907544410_6	We furthermore present and discuss trade-offs that can be made to reduce the latency and overhead caused by the transparent tunneling of traffic.
G02.2	privacy	2907544410	G02.2_2907544410_7	Based on measurements taken from a testbed setup, we show that our solution provides anonymity at the IP layer with acceptable energy consumption and goodput penalties.

G04.1	drug discovery	1527820925	G04.1_1527820925_2	In this study we compared the performance of GOLD, PMF, DOCK and FlexX scoring functions in FlexX flexible docking to cytochrome P450cam binding site.
G04.1	drug discovery	1527820925	G04.1_1527820925_3	Crystal structures of protein-substrate complexes were most effectively reproduced by the FlexX/PMF method.
G04.1	drug discovery	1527820925	G04.1_1527820925_4	On the other hand, the FlexX/GOLD approach provided the best correlation between experimental binding constants and predicted scores.
G04.1	drug discovery	1527820925	G04.1_1527820925_5	Binding modes selected by the FlexX/PMF approach were rescored by GOLD to obtain a reliable measure of binding energetics.
G04.1	drug discovery	1527820925	G04.1_1527820925_6	The effectiveness of the FlexX/PMF/GOLD method was demonstrated by the correct classification of 32 out of the 33 experimentally studied compounds and also in a virtual HTS test on a library of 10,000 compounds.
G04.1	drug discovery	1527820925	G04.1_1527820925_7	Although almost all the available functions were developed to be general, our study on cytochrome P450cam substrates suggests that careful selection or even tailoring the scoring function might increase the prediction power of virtual screens significantly.
G04.1	drug discovery	1527820925	G04.1_1527820925_8	The FlexX/PMF/GOLD methodology was tested on cytochrome P450 3A4 substrates and inhibitors.
G04.1	drug discovery	1527820925	G04.1_1527820925_9	This preliminary study revealed that the combined function was able to recognise 334 out of the 345 compounds bound to 3A4.
G04.1	drug discovery	1972320695	G04.1_1972320695_1	Over the past decade we have seen a growth in the provision of chemistry data and cheminformatics tools as either free websites or software as a service commercial offerings.
G04.1	drug discovery	1972320695	G04.1_1972320695_2	These have transformed how we find molecule-related data and use such tools in our research.
G04.1	drug discovery	1972320695	G04.1_1972320695_3	There have also been efforts to improve collaboration between researchers either openly or through secure transactions using commercial tools.
G04.1	drug discovery	1972320695	G04.1_1972320695_4	A major challenge in the future will be how such databases and software approaches handle larger amounts of data as it accumulates from high throughput screening and enables the user to draw insights, enable predictions and move projects forward.
G04.1	drug discovery	1972320695	G04.1_1972320695_5	We now discuss how information from some drug discovery datasets can be made more accessible and how privacy of data should not overwhelm the desire to share it at an appropriate time with collaborators.
G04.1	drug discovery	1972320695	G04.1_1972320695_6	We also discuss additional software tools that could be made available and provide our thoughts on the future of predictive drug discovery in this age of big data.
G04.1	drug discovery	1972320695	G04.1_1972320695_7	We use some examples from our own research on neglected diseases, collaborations, mobile apps and algorithm development to illustrate these ideas.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2768087388	G04.3_2768087388_1	Abstract   A wealth of genetic, demographic, clinical and biomarker data is collected from routine clinical care of HIV patients and exists in the form of medical records available among the medical care and research communities.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2768087388	G04.3_2768087388_2	Machine learning (ML) methods have the ability to identify and discover patterns in complex datasets and predict future outcomes of HIV treatment.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2768087388	G04.3_2768087388_3	We survey published studies that make use of ML techniques in HIV clinical research and care.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2768087388	G04.3_2768087388_4	An advanced search relevant to the use of ML in HIV research was conducted in the PubMed biomedical database.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2768087388	G04.3_2768087388_5	The survey outcomes of interest include data sources, ML techniques, ML tasks and ML application paradigms.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2768087388	G04.3_2768087388_6	A growing trend in application of ML in HIV research was observed.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2768087388	G04.3_2768087388_7	The application paradigm has diversified to include practical clinical application, but statistical analysis remains the most dominant application.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2768087388	G04.3_2768087388_8	There is an increase in the use of genomic sources of data and high performance non-parametric ML methods with a focus on combating resistance to antiretroviral therapy (ART).
G04.3	infectious diseases	2768087388	G04.3_2768087388_9	There is need for improvement in collection of health records data and increased training in ML so as to translate ML research into clinical application in HIV management.

G04.3	infectious diseases	2149280336	G04.3_2149280336_2	When the sequencing is done at high coverage depth (“deep sequencing”), low frequency variants can be detected.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2149280336	G04.3_2149280336_3	Here we present QQ-SNV (http://sourceforge.net/projects/qqsnv), a logistic regression classifier model developed for the Illumina sequencing platforms that uses the quantiles of the quality scores, to distinguish true single nucleotide variants from sequencing errors based on the estimated SNV probability.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2149280336	G04.3_2149280336_4	To train the model, we created a dataset of an in silico mixture of five HIV-1 plasmids.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2149280336	G04.3_2149280336_5	Testing of our method in comparison to the existing methods LoFreq, ShoRAH, and V-Phaser 2 was performed on two HIV and four HCV plasmid mixture datasets and one influenza H1N1 clinical dataset.

G04.3	infectious diseases	102431395	G04.3_102431395_3	These factors will be incorporated into a revised algorithm.
G04.3	infectious diseases	1832247038	G04.3_1832247038_1	Syndromic Surveillance is typically a system used for early detection of bioterrorism attacks, pandemic flu or other emerging diseases, which monitors symptoms of outpatients or is conducted in the Emergency Department.
G04.3	infectious diseases	1832247038	G04.3_1832247038_2	However, if we monitor symptoms of inpatients, we can apply Syndromic Surveillance to early detection of nosocomial infection.
G04.3	infectious diseases	1832247038	G04.3_1832247038_3	To test this possibility, we constructed and are performing a Syndromic Surveillance System for inpatients who have fever, respiratory symptoms, diarrhea, vomiting or rash.
G04.3	infectious diseases	1832247038	G04.3_1832247038_4	We will then evaluate its statistical properties and its usefulness.

G04.3	infectious diseases	1968225289	G04.3_1968225289_3	This application would be useful for analysing intra-host evolutionary pathways in relation to immune responses and antiretroviral therapy exposures.
G04.3	infectious diseases	1968225289	G04.3_1968225289_4	Here we introduce a set of formulae for the combinatorial analysis of a quasispecies, given a NGS re-sequencing experiment and an algorithm for quasispecies reconstruction.
G04.3	infectious diseases	1968225289	G04.3_1968225289_5	We require that sequenced fragments are aligned against a reference genome, and that the reference genome is partitioned into a set of sliding windows (amplicons).
G04.3	infectious diseases	1968225289	G04.3_1968225289_6	The reconstruction algorithm is based on combinations of multinomial distributions and is designed to minimise the reconstruction of false variants, called in-silico recombinants.

G06.1	ubiquity	2162324676	G06.1_2162324676_2	The notion of ubiquity will likely extend to more comprehensive ubiquitous service, as demand grows for the ability to access desired services at any time and at any place.

G06.1	ubiquity	2162324676	G06.1_2162324676_4	The etymology of ubiquity derives from a metaphysical premise of the spatial and temporal omnipresence of the divine, and the notion extends through traditional religious thought far back into prehistoric belief.
G06.1	ubiquity	2162324676	G06.1_2162324676_5	While ubiquity is clearly a highly desirable notion, it bears the danger of becoming an overly indulgent wish fulfillment, where all human needs and desires demand immediate satisfaction.

G06.1	ubiquity	2090018859	G06.1_2090018859_3	Hunting down and patching vulnerabilities is a losing game.
G06.1	ubiquity	1641568207	G06.1_1641568207_1	In this second article in the ACM Ubiquity symposium on u0027What is computation?u0027 Peter Wegner provides a history of the evolution of comptuation.

G06.1	ubiquity	2025049364	G06.1_2025049364_1	Digital machines are automating knowledge work at an accelerating pace.
G06.1	ubiquity	2025049364	G06.1_2025049364_2	How shall we learn and stay relevant?
G06.1	ubiquity	2077083913	G06.1_2077083913_1	A number of themes have been on my mind in recent months, and I have made them centerpieces of a number of things I have written lately.
G06.1	ubiquity	2077083913	G06.1_2077083913_2	In a Ubiquity essay Durbin (ACM Ubiquity 8(45):26, 2007a), I said that I am happy that there are computer professionals who are activists, joining with others to solve the technosocial problems that vex our society, including problems of the computer and information professions.
G06.1	ubiquity	2077083913	G06.1_2077083913_3	I here moved beyond that to make a new claim about needed changes.
G06.1	ubiquity	2040220204	G06.1_2040220204_1	For years we humans have worried about plagues, asteroids, earthquakes, eruptions, fires, floods, famines, wars, genocides, and other uncontrollable events that could wipe away our civilization.
G06.1	ubiquity	2040220204	G06.1_2040220204_2	In the modern age, with so much depending on computing and communications, we have added computers to our list of potential threats.
G06.1	ubiquity	2040220204	G06.1_2040220204_3	Could we perish from the increasing intelligence of computers?
G06.1	ubiquity	2040220204	G06.1_2040220204_4	Denning thinks that is less of a threat than the apparently mundane march of automated bureaucracies.
G06.1	ubiquity	2040220204	G06.1_2040220204_5	He also asserts that none of the possible negative outcomes is a forgone conclusion because humans teaming with machines are far more intelligent than either one alone.
G06.1	ubiquity	2053059828	G06.1_2053059828_1	We are witnessing these days the rise of always-on, connected devices, systems and environments.
G06.1	ubiquity	2053059828	G06.1_2053059828_2	This might well represent the basis for the emerging digital economy.
G06.1	ubiquity	2053059828	G06.1_2053059828_3	This symposium brings in diverse points of views trying to synthesize the most likely future of Internet of Things (IoT).
G06.2	self driving	2942959816	G06.2_2942959816_1	The arrival of self-driving cars and smart technologies is fraught with controversy, as users hesitate to cede control to machines for vital tasks.
G06.2	self driving	2942959816	G06.2_2942959816_2	While advances in engineering have made such autonomous technology a reality, considerable design work is needed to motivate their mass adoption.
G06.2	self driving	2942959816	G06.2_2942959816_3	What are the key predictors of peopleu0027s acceptance of self-driving cars?
G06.2	self driving	2942959816	G06.2_2942959816_4	Is it the ease of use or coolness aspect?
G06.2	self driving	2942959816	G06.2_2942959816_5	Is it the degree of perceived control for users?
G06.2	self driving	2942959816	G06.2_2942959816_6	"We decided to find out with a survey (N = 404) assessing acceptance of self-driving cars, and discovered that the strongest predictor is ""posthuman ability,"" suggesting that individuals are much more accepting of technology that can clearly outclass human abilities."
G06.2	self driving	2897892437	G06.2_2897892437_1	Self-Driving cars is a fast-growing area of study both in academia and industry.
G06.2	self driving	2897892437	G06.2_2897892437_2	It is part of a broader domain which involves the development of software for Highly Automated Vehicles (HAV) and notions extracted from Artificial Intelligence/Autonomous Systems (AI/AS).
G06.2	self driving	2897892437	G06.2_2897892437_3	There are many challenges that must be overcome to deliver self-driving cars in a manner that is readily accepted by consumers and society.
G06.2	self driving	2897892437	G06.2_2897892437_4	Studies have shown that although many people are comfortable with the idea of AI helping them to operate their houses or schedule appointments, not many people are comfortable with the idea of cars being driven by AI algorithms.
G06.2	self driving	2897892437	G06.2_2897892437_5	At the same time, insurance companies are concerned about vehicle liability issues and how to demonstrate who/what caused an accident.
G06.2	self driving	2897892437	G06.2_2897892437_6	We believe that self-driving cars that demonstrate transparency in their operations will increase consumer trust which is pivotal to its acceptance and will pave the way for its commercialization and daily use.
G06.2	self driving	2897892437	G06.2_2897892437_7	In this work, we investigate how to pursue the elicitation and modeling of transparency as a Non-Functional Requirement (NFR) to produce self-driving cars that are more robust.
G06.2	self driving	2955453634	G06.2_2955453634_1	Autonomous driving carries the promise to drastically reduce the number of car accidents; however, recently reported fatal crashes involving self-driving cars show this important goal is not yet achieved, and call for better testing of the software controlling self-driving cars.
G06.2	self driving	2955453634	G06.2_2955453634_2	To better test self-driving car software, we propose to specifically test critical scenarios.
G06.2	self driving	2955453634	G06.2_2955453634_3	Since these are difficult to test in field operation, we create simulations of critical situations.
G06.2	self driving	2955453634	G06.2_2955453634_4	These simulations are automatically derived from natural language police reports of actual car crashes, which are available in historical datasets.
G06.2	self driving	2955453634	G06.2_2955453634_5	Our initial evaluation shows that we can generate accurate simulations in a matter of minutes.
G06.2	self driving	2956093012	G06.2_2956093012_1	Autonomous driving carries the promise to drastically reduce car accidents, but recently reported fatal crashes involving self-driving cars suggest that the self-driving car software should be tested more thoroughly.
G06.2	self driving	2956093012	G06.2_2956093012_2	For addressing this need, we introduce AC3R (Automatic Crash Constructor from Crash Report) which elaborates police reports to automatically recreate car crashes in a simulated environment that can be used for testing self-driving car software in critical situations.
G06.2	self driving	2956093012	G06.2_2956093012_3	AC3R enables developers to quickly generate relevant test cases from the massive historical dataset of recorded car crashes.
G06.2	self driving	2956093012	G06.2_2956093012_4	We demonstrate how AC3R can generate simulations of different car crashes and report the findings of a large user study which concluded that AC3R simulations are accurate.
G06.2	self driving	2956093012	G06.2_2956093012_5	A video illustrating AC3R in action is available at: https://youtu.be/V708fDG_ux8
G06.2	self driving	2876187414	G06.2_2876187414_1	As the number of connected devices in the network is growing rapidly, network management is becoming more complex.
G06.2	self driving	2876187414	G06.2_2876187414_2	Closed-loop network management can be a solution to address the problem, and self-driving network concept is one of the most promising solution.
G06.2	self driving	2876187414	G06.2_2876187414_3	To realize the self-driving network, Knowledge-Defined Networking (KDN), network telemetry and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) are essential parts.
G06.2	self driving	2876187414	G06.2_2876187414_4	As a first step toward realizing self-driving network, in this paper, we propose an architecture for self-driving network and suggest its use cases.
G06.2	self driving	2876187414	G06.2_2876187414_5	We also present network monitoring system implemen­tation on SDN controller using INT, and discuss its limitations.
G06.2	self driving	2805709932	G06.2_2805709932_1	Self-driving cars currently face a lot of technological problems that need to be solved before the cars can be widely used.
G06.2	self driving	2805709932	G06.2_2805709932_2	However, they also face ethical problems, among which the question of crash-optimization algorithms is most prominently discussed.
G06.2	self driving	2805709932	G06.2_2805709932_3	Reviewing current debates about whether we should use the ethics of the Trolley Dilemma as a guide towards designing self-driving cars will provide us with insights about what exactly ethical research does.
G06.2	self driving	2805709932	G06.2_2805709932_4	It will result in the view that although we need the ethics of the Trolley Dilemma as important input for self-driving cars, the route towards simply implementing it into automated cars is blocked.
G06.2	self driving	2807152183	G06.2_2807152183_1	"In this talk our solutions to the four core modules in self-driving cars, ""Where am I?"
G06.2	self driving	2807152183	G06.2_2807152183_2	""", ""Whatu0027s around me?"
G06.2	self driving	2807152183	G06.2_2807152183_3	""", ""What will happen next"" and ""What should I do?"""
G06.2	self driving	2807152183	G06.2_2807152183_4	will be described.
G06.2	self driving	2807152183	G06.2_2807152183_5	The lessons learned, business opportunities and challenges for deploying self-driving cars at scale will be discussed.
G06.2	self driving	2613626094	G06.2_2613626094_1	As self-driving cars begin to make their way on to the road, there is a growing need for research to understand acceptance of the technology among potential users.
G06.2	self driving	2613626094	G06.2_2613626094_2	This study looked at responses from a national sample of 1,765 adults in the United States to uncover key determinants of the acceptance of self-driving cars and to understand how age and other characteristics relate to perceptions of and attitudes toward self-driving cars.
G06.2	self driving	2613626094	G06.2_2613626094_3	Data from the online survey showed that perceived usefulness, affordability, social support, lifestyle fit and conceptual compatibility are key predictors of acceptance of self-driving cars across ages.
G06.2	self driving	2613626094	G06.2_2613626094_4	A comparison across generational cohorts (i.e., Millennials, Generation X, Baby Boomers and the Silent Generation) found that age negatively affects perceptions of a self-driving car, interest in using it, and behavioral intentions to use one when it becomes available.
G06.2	self driving	2613626094	G06.2_2613626094_5	Furthermore, experiential characteristics associated with age, including experiences with, knowledge of and trust toward technology in general, were found to have significant influence on how people felt about self-driving cars.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	1191305582	G08.1_1191305582_1	This paper describes a study to understand what differentiates organization adopters of Bitcoin from nonadopters by comparing their IT-readiness, innovativeness and social media presence.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	1191305582	G08.1_1191305582_2	The craze over cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin has been likened to a modern-day gold rush, yet academic research has not caught up.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	1191305582	G08.1_1191305582_3	Governments are struggling with the very idea of cryptocurrency systems.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	1191305582	G08.1_1191305582_4	After the price of Bitcoin fell from $1,200 to $300 in 2014, consumer interest flagged, leaving the future of Bitcoin adoption uncertain despite a slow and steady increase of organization adopters.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	1191305582	G08.1_1191305582_5	Organization adoption is more important than consumer, because consumers can’t use cryptocurrency if organizations don’t accept them as payment.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	1191305582	G08.1_1191305582_6	This research serves as a basis for future research on Bitcoins and Bitcoin adoption by highlighting some important hurdles to its adoption as a new innovation, in the hope that such endeavors move us ever closer to the vision of a true “people’s currency.”
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2963010231	G08.1_2963010231_1	A Blockchain is a global shared infrastructure where cryptocurrency transactions among addresses are recorded, validated and made publicly available in a peer-to-peer network.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2963010231	G08.1_2963010231_2	To date, the best known and important cryptocurrency is the bitcoin.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2963010231	G08.1_2963010231_3	In this paper, we focus on this cryptocurrency and in particular on the modeling of the Bitcoin Blockchain by using the Petri Nets formalism.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2963010231	G08.1_2963010231_4	The proposed model allows us to quickly collect information about identities owning Bitcoin addresses and to recover measures and statistics on the Bitcoin network.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2963010231	G08.1_2963010231_5	By exploiting algebraic formalism, we reconstructed an Entities network associated to Blockchain transactions gathering together Bitcoin addresses into the single entity holding permits to manage Bitcoins held by those addresses.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2963010231	G08.1_2963010231_6	The model allows also to identify a set of behaviors typical of Bitcoin owners, like that of using an address only once, and to reconstruct chains for this behavior together with the rate of firing.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2963010231	G08.1_2963010231_7	Our model is highly flexible and can easily be adapted to include different features of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency system.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2963010231	G08.1_2963010231_8	By exploiting algebraic formalism, we reconstructed an Entities network associated to Blockchain transactions gathering together Bitcoin addresses into the single entity holding permits to manage Bitcoins held by those addresses.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2963010231	G08.1_2963010231_9	The model allows also to identify a set of behaviors typical of Bitcoin owners, like that of using an address only once, and to reconstruct chains for this behavior together with the rate of firing.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2963010231	G08.1_2963010231_10	Our model is highly flexible and can easily be adapted to include different features of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency system.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2807731845	G08.1_2807731845_1	With the price of Bitcoin ascending to new heights in 2017, the rocketing valuation of cryptocurrencies continues its momentum into 2018.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2807731845	G08.1_2807731845_2	Evidence of the massive growth of these digital assets can be seen in the massive spikes in new clients at companies like Coinbase, adding 100,000 users in a 24-hour period, and Binance, which recently expanded its user base by 240,000 users in just one hour.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2807731845	G08.1_2807731845_3	The financial industry and Silicon Valley are not the only groups who have caught the cryptocurrency fever.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2807731845	G08.1_2807731845_4	Malicious actors have discovered that cryptocurrency newbies are unwitting targets that offer a consistent stream of revenue.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2807731845	G08.1_2807731845_5	Through our global network visibility, Cisco has observed many of these attacks originating from bulletproof hosting infrastructures located in the Eastern European region.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2807731845	G08.1_2807731845_6	This area is a hotbed for crypto theft and other computer crimes such as ransomware, botnets, DDoS services and credit card fraud.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2807731845	G08.1_2807731845_7	Some criminals have even extended beyond the digital world by kidnapping and demanding ransoms in Bitcoin, such as the case in the reported kidnapping and ransom of Pavel Lerner.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2807731845	G08.1_2807731845_8	Lerner was a lead analyst at Ukraine-based digital currency exchange, Exmo, who was released by his kidnappers after a $1 million Bitcoin payment was made.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2807731845	G08.1_2807731845_9	The event illustrates the desperate lengths some criminals will go in order to steal cryptocurrency.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2807731845	G08.1_2807731845_10	Joining the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance in 2017, Cisco is committed to protecting these new crypto technologies.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2807731845	G08.1_2807731845_11	"Over the past year Cisco researchers have teamed up with the Ukraine Cyber Police to track a Bitcoin phishing operation dubbed the ""Coinhoarder"" campaign that has been tied to the theft of tens of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin."
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2807731845	G08.1_2807731845_12	Credential phishing continues to be one of the biggest security challenges for internet users, and cryptocurrency phishers have found it to be a very lucrative form of attack.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2807731845	G08.1_2807731845_13	In 2017, Chainalysis reported Ethereum phishing as being the number one source of theft in that ecosystem with estimates placing the total amount stolen at $115 million.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2807731845	G08.1_2807731845_14	Google also recently published a research paper stating credential phishing is one of their top security challenges.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2807731845	G08.1_2807731845_15	Cisco has been proactive in detecting phishing domains in predictive fashion to help protect our customers.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2807731845	G08.1_2807731845_16	Additionally, we have been working with security personnel at top cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges, such as Blockchain.info and Coinbase, to help protect the cryptocurrency community members from having their tokens stolen.
G09.1	forensics	2735724513	G09.1_2735724513_1	Nowadays, the need to tackle rapidly increased crimes is increasing day by day to help ensuring justice.
G09.1	forensics	2735724513	G09.1_2735724513_2	Digital forensics can be defined as the process of collecting, examining, analyzing and reporting of digital evidence without any damage.
G09.1	forensics	2735724513	G09.1_2735724513_3	Digital forensics requires a detailed examination of devices such as computers, mobile phones, sim cards, tablets that contain digital evidence regardless of whether the crime is large or small.
G09.1	forensics	2735724513	G09.1_2735724513_4	Among these devices, mobile phones take an important place in digital forensics because of their widely usages by every individual.
G09.1	forensics	2735724513	G09.1_2735724513_5	The importance of examining of the data called as evidence in mobile phones has increased with advances in technology, operation capacity, storage capacity and functionality.
G09.1	forensics	2735724513	G09.1_2735724513_6	In a forensics case, mobile phones must be examined by authorized persons and the data obtained from the device must be brought to standards that can be used forensically.
G09.1	forensics	2735724513	G09.1_2735724513_7	In this study, examination and analysis of mobile phones in terms of digital forensics is evaluated.
G09.1	forensics	2735724513	G09.1_2735724513_8	At the same time, data that can be obtained from mobile phones through a sample application has been investigated.
G10.2	disrupting	2344944123	G10.2_2344944123_1	This instalment of the Impact department questions the impact of software growth and asks whether itu0027s possible to innovate constructively without seriously disrupting the balance of our society.
G14.1	online safety for children	2796419887	G14.1_2796419887_1	"Mobile applications (""apps"") developed to promote online safety for children are underutilized and rely heavily on parental control features that monitor and restrict their childu0027s mobile activities."
G14.1	online safety for children	2796419887	G14.1_2796419887_2	This asymmetry in parental surveillance initiates an interesting research question -- how do children themselves feel about such parental control apps?
G14.1	online safety for children	2796419887	G14.1_2796419887_3	We conducted a qualitative analysis of 736 reviews of 37 mobile online safety apps from Google Play that were publicly posted and written by children (ages 8-19).
G14.1	online safety for children	2796419887	G14.1_2796419887_4	Our results indicate that child ratings were significantly lower than that of parents with 76% of the child reviews giving apps a single star.
G14.1	online safety for children	2796419887	G14.1_2796419887_5	Children felt that the apps were overly restrictive and invasive of their personal privacy, negatively impacting their relationships with their parents.
G14.1	online safety for children	2796419887	G14.1_2796419887_6	We relate these findings with HCI literature on mobile online safety, including broader literature around privacy and surveillance, and outline design opportunities for online safety apps.
G15.2	cookies	2943725908	G15.2_2943725908_1	The recently introduced General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires that when obtaining information online that could be used to identify individuals, their consents must be obtained.
G15.2	cookies	2943725908	G15.2_2943725908_2	Among other things, this affects many common forms of cookies, and users in the EU have been presented with notices asking their approvals for data collection.
G15.2	cookies	2943725908	G15.2_2943725908_3	This paper examines the prevalence of third party cookies before and after GDPR by using two datasets: accesses to top 500 websites according to Alexa.com, and weekly data of cookies placed in usersu0027 browsers by websites accessed by 16 UK and China users across one year.
G15.2	cookies	2943725908	G15.2_2943725908_4	We find that on average the number of third parties dropped by more than 10% after GDPR, but when we examine real usersu0027 browsing histories over a year, we find that there is no material reduction in long-term numbers of third party cookies, suggesting that users are not making use of the choices offered by GDPR for increased privacy.
G15.2	cookies	2943725908	G15.2_2943725908_5	Also, among websites which offer users a choice in whether and how they are tracked, accepting the default choices typically ends up storing more cookies on average than on websites which provide a notice of cookies stored but without giving users a choice of which cookies, or those that do not provide a cookie notice at all.
G15.2	cookies	2943725908	G15.2_2943725908_6	We also find that top non-EU websites have fewer cookie notices, suggesting higher levels of tracking when visiting international sites.
G15.2	cookies	2943725908	G15.2_2943725908_7	Our findings have deep implications both for understanding compliance with GDPR as well as understanding the evolution of tracking on the web.
G15.3	gdpr	2906041246	G15.3_2906041246_1	The interaction between patients and health providers through mobile apps can potentially improve the efficiency and quality of healthcare.

G15.3	gdpr	2906041246	G15.3_2906041246_3	Since May 2018, this lack of security awareness and measures has to change.
G15.3	gdpr	2906041246	G15.3_2906041246_4	With the application of the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the European residentsu0027 personal data processing by third parties will be stricter and more controlled.
G15.3	gdpr	2906041246	G15.3_2906041246_5	On the way to understanding how GDPR affects the content and interactions of mHealth apps, this article aims to compare how previous legislation is reflected in the interactions between users and those apps and what key changes must take place now that GDPR is in force.
G15.3	gdpr	2906041246	G15.3_2906041246_6	GDPR empowers patients to ask and receive in a simple understandable manner, information about the security measures that are applied to protect their personal data and transparently see how their personal data is processed, by whom and to what purposes.
G15.3	gdpr	2906041246	G15.3_2906041246_7	Use-case scenarios are presented to discuss the impact of GDPR key changes in the visual interactions between the user/patient and mHealth apps and how the app content can be adapted to a more objective and uncluttered view.
G15.3	gdpr	2906041246	G15.3_2906041246_8	This study provides means to easily and quickly integrate the key privacy and legislation requirements from GDPR into app visualization, improving this way availability, transparency and patientsu0027 empowerment.
G15.3	gdpr	2994850812	G15.3_2994850812_1	In 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force, imposing strict laws aimed to protect the privacy of natural persons in member states of the European Union.
G15.3	gdpr	2994850812	G15.3_2994850812_2	However, the implications of the GDPR with respect to gathering, storing, and analyzing online user feedback — which is an important source of information for Crowd-based Requirements Engineering (CrowdRE) — have not been assessed yet.
G15.3	gdpr	2994850812	G15.3_2994850812_3	User feedback has been found to contain personal data, so the GDPR applies.
G15.3	gdpr	2994850812	G15.3_2994850812_4	It may be used for CrowdRE if conditions regarding data storage and handling are met and if, when used commercially, the duty to inform is carried out and the data subjectsu0027 rights and freedoms are respected.
G15.3	gdpr	2994850812	G15.3_2994850812_5	This can be a burden on the application of CrowdRE and might even inhibit its adoption.
G15.3	gdpr	2994850812	G15.3_2994850812_6	We propose a heuristic-based solution to anonymize the most prevalent types of personal data while crawling user feedback so that the data processing is no longer subject to GDPR.
G15.3	gdpr	2982224975	G15.3_2982224975_1	The European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) governs personal data processing, aiming to ensure privacy in all systems handling such data.
G15.3	gdpr	2982224975	G15.3_2982224975_2	All systems that process personal data, including software systems are legally obliged to comply to all articles of the GDPR applicable to them.
G15.3	gdpr	2982224975	G15.3_2982224975_3	In this paper, the case study of an e-Learning software platform, namely the INFORM platform and its compliance to relevant articles of the GDPR is presented.
G15.3	gdpr	2982224975	G15.3_2982224975_4	The e-Learning platform was developed with the objective to host the educational material developed under the JUSTICE EU-funded project INFORM, targeting judiciary, court staff and legal practitioners, in order to provide free and open distance access to the content.
G15.3	gdpr	2982224975	G15.3_2982224975_5	In particular, the paper demonstrates the compliance of the platform with the articles and principles of: Data Minimisation, Lawfulness of Processing, Right to Erasure, Right of Access, Right to Data Portability, Right to Rectification and Security of Processing.
G15.3	gdpr	2982224975	G15.3_2982224975_6	By applying these articles, conformance to the provision for Data Protection by design is also achieved; the platform’s software development process integrates the articles of the GDPR early in the development steps, from the specification and design phases.
G15.3	gdpr	2982224975	G15.3_2982224975_7	We show how the design process progressed and demonstrate the corresponding functionality within the e-Learning platform.
G15.3	gdpr	2982224975	G15.3_2982224975_8	The paper extracts a list of lessons learned and conclusions on software GDPR compliance.
G15.3	gdpr	2982142438	G15.3_2982142438_1	Since the entry into force of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), public and private organizations face unprecedented challenges to ensure compliance with new data protection rules.
G15.3	gdpr	2982142438	G15.3_2982142438_2	To help its implementation, academics and technologists proposed innovative solutions leading to what is known today as privacy engineering.
G15.3	gdpr	2982142438	G15.3_2982142438_3	Among the main goals of these solutions are to enable compliant data processing by controllers and to increase trust in compliance by data subjects.
G15.3	gdpr	2982142438	G15.3_2982142438_4	While data protection by design (Article 25 of GDPR) constitutes a keystone of the regulation, many legacy systems are not designed and implemented with this concept in mind, but still process large quantities of personal data.
G15.3	gdpr	2982142438	G15.3_2982142438_5	Consequently, there is a need for “after design” ways to check compliance and remediate to data protection issues.
G15.3	gdpr	2982142438	G15.3_2982142438_6	In this paper, we propose to monitor and check the compliance of legacy systems through their logs.
G15.3	gdpr	2982142438	G15.3_2982142438_7	In order to make it possible, we modelled a core subset of the GDPR in the Prolog language.
G15.3	gdpr	2982142438	G15.3_2982142438_8	The approach we followed produced an operational model of the GDPR which eases the interactions with standard operational models of Information Technology (IT) systems.
G15.3	gdpr	2982142438	G15.3_2982142438_9	Different dimensions required to properly address data protection obligations have been covered, and in particular time-related properties such as retention time.
G15.3	gdpr	2982142438	G15.3_2982142438_10	The logic-based GDPR model has also been kept as close as possible to the legal wording to allow a Data Protection Officer to explore the model in case of need.
G15.3	gdpr	2982142438	G15.3_2982142438_11	Finally, even if we don’t have a completed tool yet, we created a proof-of-concept framework to use the GDPR model to detect data protection compliance violations by monitoring the IT system logs.
G15.3	gdpr	2967399871	G15.3_2967399871_1	General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) targets personal data protection of the European Union citizens, with a strong input on the rights of people to control their data.
G15.3	gdpr	2967399871	G15.3_2967399871_2	Current GDPR solutions are adhoc and are still challenging for scalable systems like Internet of Things (IoT).
G15.3	gdpr	2967399871	G15.3_2967399871_3	In this paper, we propose a general solution of a GDPR Controller in IoT systems.
G15.3	gdpr	2967399871	G15.3_2967399871_4	The controller gives the data owner a full control of his data: setting security policies, modifying them on run time, tracking data flow and notifying him for any illicit access.
G15.3	gdpr	2967399871	G15.3_2967399871_5	The controller architecture is validated and evaluated using an e-health use case with acceptable overhead on the system performance.

G15.3	gdpr	2962807203	G15.3_2962807203_2	During the past year or so, Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) across different countries have worked diligently to enforce compliance and ensure that the core principles at the heart of the GDPR are met – namely responsible and transparent handling and protection of individuals’ personal data.
G15.3	gdpr	2962807203	G15.3_2962807203_3	Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) across Europe have worked diligently to enforce compliance and ensure that the core principles at the heart of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are met.
G15.3	gdpr	2962807203	G15.3_2962807203_4	Meanwhile, organisations have worked to ensure compliance.

G15.3	gdpr	2962807203	G15.3_2962807203_8	And what impact will the UKu0027s impending exit from the European Union (EU) have on regulatory compliance and data flows?
G15.3	gdpr	2897953540	G15.3_2897953540_1	The Internet of Things has become a key enabling technology for data-intensive research across universities and private organisations alike.
G15.3	gdpr	2897953540	G15.3_2897953540_2	However, the recent introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe has raised concerns that the GDPR might hamper data-intensive research.
G15.3	gdpr	2897953540	G15.3_2897953540_3	In this paper, we address the question of how to enable ethical and compliant research with personal IoT data in an academic environment.
G15.3	gdpr	2897953540	G15.3_2897953540_4	We identify three novel trust principles for GDPR compliant use of personal IoT data in science and research (private-by-default, analytics transparency and Accountable analytics) and propose an architecture for a trusted IoT research infrastructure.

G15.3	gdpr	2888524033	G15.3_2888524033_1	With the GDPR coming into force in 2018, organizations require techniques to assess and improve the current state of their data processing activities with regards to personal data.
G15.3	gdpr	2888524033	G15.3_2888524033_2	Although current research has explored GDPR compliance to some degree, the work is either highly generalized or focused on specific principles within the legislation.
G15.3	gdpr	2888524033	G15.3_2888524033_3	This paper presents the current state of a model of the GDPR that provides a concise visual overview of the associations between entities defined in the legislation and their constraints.
G15.3	gdpr	2888524033	G15.3_2888524033_4	We also discuss its application directions towards the development of an overall approach to organizational privacy management - as a visual representation and as a tool to aid the definition of privacy policy.
G15.3	gdpr	2885667908	G15.3_2885667908_1	The goal of the project described in this paper is to describe a GDPR compliance checking model and tool for supporting the information exchange between CERTs.
G15.3	gdpr	2885667908	G15.3_2885667908_2	The paper first motivates the project, and then briefly discusses major aspects of GDPR, before presenting the developed model and the implemented prototype.
G15.3	gdpr	2885667908	G15.3_2885667908_3	A discussion and an outlook conclude the paper.
G15.3	gdpr	2810753913	G15.3_2810753913_1	First part of paper addresses the impact of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on data collection by most popular social networks.
G15.3	gdpr	2810753913	G15.3_2810753913_2	GDPR will start to apply on May 25th 2018, and it aims to change the way in which organizations treat data protection.
G15.3	gdpr	2810753913	G15.3_2810753913_3	Regulation requires organizations, including social networking service providers (SNSP), operating within the EU to know where personal information of their users is located, how can it be used and when does it have to be deleted.
G15.3	gdpr	2810753913	G15.3_2810753913_4	The paper clarifies the rights of the users and the obligations of the SNSP.
G15.3	gdpr	2810753913	G15.3_2810753913_5	It analyzes 10 most popular social networks and explores what personal information they collect as well as problems related to the application of GDPR.
G15.3	gdpr	2810753913	G15.3_2810753913_6	Second part of the paper presents the use of social networks in omnichannel contact center.
G15.3	gdpr	2810753913	G15.3_2810753913_7	Omnichannel is a business model which combines various communication channels in order to improve customer experience.
G15.3	gdpr	2810753913	G15.3_2810753913_8	Since modern social networks are abundant with personal user information, it is necessary to determine which of them may be collected and used by omnichannel contact center, while respecting the principles of GDPR.
G15.3	gdpr	2807773019	G15.3_2807773019_1	It is important for organisations to ensure that their privacy policies are General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliant, and this has to be done by the May 2018 deadline.
G15.3	gdpr	2807773019	G15.3_2807773019_2	However, it is also important for these policies to be designed with the needs of the human recipient in mind.
G15.3	gdpr	2807773019	G15.3_2807773019_3	We carried out an investigation to find out how best to achieve this.We commenced by synthesising the GDPR requirements into a checklist-type format.
G15.3	gdpr	2807773019	G15.3_2807773019_4	We then derived a list of usability design guidelines for privacy notifications from the research literature.We augmented the recommendations with other findings reported in the research literature, in order to confirm the guidelines.
G15.3	gdpr	2807773019	G15.3_2807773019_5	We conclude by providing a usable and GDPR-compliant privacy policy template for the benefit of policy writers.
G15.3	gdpr	2785194163	G15.3_2785194163_1	WP29 has recently adopted Guidelines on Automated Individual Decision-making and Profiling for the purposes of General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR).
G15.3	gdpr	2785194163	G15.3_2785194163_2	Article 22 GDPR bans all decisions that affect the data subject which have been based solely on automated processing.
G15.3	gdpr	2785194163	G15.3_2785194163_3	The Article eventually allows automatic processing, conditional on application of suitable safeguards for data subject rights.
G15.3	gdpr	2785194163	G15.3_2785194163_4	These safeguards might vary substantially depending on automated processing technologies.
G15.3	gdpr	2785194163	G15.3_2785194163_5	This article describes, firstly, the general safeguards to embed legal requirements.
G15.3	gdpr	2785194163	G15.3_2785194163_6	Secondly, the article explores solutions for automatic processing based on data analysis.
G15.3	gdpr	2785194163	G15.3_2785194163_7	It is argued that, although the data controller can put in place safeguards that respect data subject rights, a parallel empowerment of external authorities will be necessary to reach both: an informed external oversight, and the full application of this right.
G15.3	gdpr	2785194163	G15.3_2785194163_8	This article seeks to provide an analysis of Article 22 GDPR in the hope that this will inform the policy debate.

G15.3	gdpr	2753603513	G15.3_2753603513_1	The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a European Union regulation that will replace the existing Data Protection Directive on 25 May 2018.
G15.3	gdpr	2753603513	G15.3_2753603513_2	The most significant change is a huge increase in the maximum fine that can be levied for breaches of the regulation.
G15.3	gdpr	2753603513	G15.3_2753603513_3	Yet fewer than half of UK companies are fully aware of GDPR--and a number of those who were preparing for it stopped doing so when the Brexit vote was announced.
G15.3	gdpr	2753603513	G15.3_2753603513_4	A last-minute rush to become compliant is therefore expected, and numerous companies are starting to offer advice, checklists and consultancy on how to comply with GDPR.
G15.3	gdpr	2753603513	G15.3_2753603513_5	In such an environment, artificial intelligence technologies ought to be able to assist by providing best advice; asking all and only the relevant questions; monitoring activities; and carrying out assessments.
G15.3	gdpr	2753603513	G15.3_2753603513_6	The paper considers four areas of GDPR compliance where rule based technologies and/or machine learning techniques may be relevant: Following compliance checklists and codes of conduct; Supporting risk assessments; Complying with the new regulations regarding technologies that perform automatic profiling; Complying with the new regulations concerning recognising and reporting breaches of security.
G15.3	gdpr	2753603513	G15.3_2753603513_7	It concludes that AI technology can support each of these four areas.
G15.3	gdpr	2753603513	G15.3_2753603513_8	The requirements that GDPR (or organisations that need to comply with GDPR) state for explanation and justification of reasoning imply that rule-based approaches are likely to be more helpful than machine learning approaches.
G15.3	gdpr	2753603513	G15.3_2753603513_9	However, there may be good business reasons to take a different approach in some circumstances.
G15.3	gdpr	2891980658	G15.3_2891980658_1	With the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), an increasing need for preserving the privacy of personal data has been realized.
G15.3	gdpr	2891980658	G15.3_2891980658_2	In this context, the EU has recently published the general data protection regulation (GDPR), which ensures strengthening of the privacy rights of the data subjects concerning their personal data.
G15.3	gdpr	2891980658	G15.3_2891980658_3	In this paper, we present the importance of having a holistic solution aimed towards the enforcement of the GDPR.
G15.3	gdpr	2891980658	G15.3_2891980658_4	As a first step towards the enforcement of the GDPR, we present the research challenges in facilitating the erasure of data as per the right to erasure.
G15.3	gdpr	2891980658	G15.3_2891980658_5	We also propose the envisaged technical solutions to work through the challenges.
