G11.1	drones	2892036907	G11.1_2892036907_1	In the modern era of automation and robotics, autonomous vehicles are currently the focus of academic and industrial research.
G11.1	drones	2892036907	G11.1_2892036907_2	With the ever increasing number of unmanned aerial vehicles getting involved in activities in the civilian and commercial domain, there is an increased need for autonomy in these systems too.
G11.1	drones	2892036907	G11.1_2892036907_3	Due to guidelines set by the governments regarding the operation ceiling of civil drones, road-tracking based navigation is garnering interest.
G11.1	drones	2892036907	G11.1_2892036907_4	In an attempt to achieve the above mentioned tasks, we propose an imitation learning based, data-driven solution to UAV autonomy for navigating through city streets by learning to fly by imitating an expert pilot.
G11.1	drones	2892036907	G11.1_2892036907_5	Derived from the classic image classification algorithms, our classifier has been constructed in the form of a fast 39-layered Inception model, that evaluates the presence of roads using the tomographic reconstructions of the input frames.
G11.1	drones	2892036907	G11.1_2892036907_6	Based on the Inception-v3 architecture, our system performs better in terms of processing complexity and accuracy than many existing models for imitation learning.
G11.1	drones	2892036907	G11.1_2892036907_7	The data used for training the system has been captured from the drone, by flying it in and around urban and semi-urban streets, by experts having at least 6-8 years of flying experience.
G11.1	drones	2892036907	G11.1_2892036907_8	Permissions were taken from required authorities who made sure that minimal risk (to pedestrians) is involved in the data collection process.
G11.1	drones	2892036907	G11.1_2892036907_9	With the extensive amount of drone data that we collected, we have been able to navigate successfully through roads without crashing or overshooting, with an accuracy of 98.44%.
G11.1	drones	2892036907	G11.1_2892036907_10	The computational efficiency of MAVNet enables the drone to fly at high speeds of up to 6m/sec.
G11.1	drones	2892036907	G11.1_2892036907_11	We present the same results in this research and compare them with other state-of-the-art methods of vision and learning based navigation.
G06.2	self driving	2889433965	G06.2_2889433965_1	Recognizing Traffic Signs using intelligent systems can drastically reduce the number of accidents happening world-wide.
G06.2	self driving	2889433965	G06.2_2889433965_2	With the arrival of Self-driving cars it has become a staple challenge to solve the automatic recognition of Traffic and Hand-held signs in the major streets.
G06.2	self driving	2889433965	G06.2_2889433965_3	Various machine learning techniques like Random Forest, SVM as well as deep learning models has been proposed for classifying traffic signs.
G06.2	self driving	2889433965	G06.2_2889433965_4	Though they reach state-of-the-art performance on a particular data-set, but fall short of tackling multiple Traffic Sign Recognition benchmarks.
G06.2	self driving	2889433965	G06.2_2889433965_5	In this paper, we propose a novel and one-for-all architecture that aces multiple benchmarks with better overall score than the state-of-the-art architectures.
G06.2	self driving	2889433965	G06.2_2889433965_6	Our model is made of residual convolutional blocks with hierarchical dilated skip connections joined in steps.
G06.2	self driving	2889433965	G06.2_2889433965_7	With this we score 99.33% Accuracy in German sign recognition benchmark and 99.17% Accuracy in Belgian traffic sign classification benchmark.
G06.2	self driving	2889433965	G06.2_2889433965_8	Moreover, we propose a newly devised dilated residual learning representation technique which is very low in both memory and computational complexity.
G06.2	self driving	2810968146	G06.2_2810968146_1	We introduce Ignition: an end-to-end neural network architecture for training unconstrained self-driving vehicles in simulated environments.
G06.2	self driving	2810968146	G06.2_2810968146_2	The model is a ResNet-18 variant, which is fed in images from the front of a simulated F1 car, and outputs optimal labels for steering, throttle, braking.
G06.2	self driving	2810968146	G06.2_2810968146_3	Importantly, we never explicitly train the model to detect road features like the outline of a track or distance to other cars; instead, we illustrate that these latent features can be automatically encapsulated by the network.
G06.2	self driving	2890116921	G06.2_2890116921_1	In this paper, we present a transfer learning method for the end-to-end control of self-driving cars, which enables a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a source domain to be utilized for the same task in a different target domain.
G06.2	self driving	2890116921	G06.2_2890116921_2	A conventional CNN for the end-to-end control is designed to map a single front-facing camera image to a steering command.
G06.2	self driving	2890116921	G06.2_2890116921_3	To enable the transfer learning, we let the CNN produce not only a steering command but also a lane departure level (LDL) by adding a new task module, which takes the output of the last convolutional layer as input.
G06.2	self driving	2890116921	G06.2_2890116921_4	The CNN trained on the source domain, called source network, is then utilized to train another task module called target network, which also takes the output of the last convolutional layer of the source network and is trained to produce a steering command for the target domain.
G06.2	self driving	2890116921	G06.2_2890116921_5	The steering commands from the source and target network are finally merged according to the LDL and the merged command is utilized for controlling a car in the target domain.
G06.2	self driving	2890116921	G06.2_2890116921_6	To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we utilized two simulators, TORCS and GTAV, for the source and the target domains, respectively.
G06.2	self driving	2890116921	G06.2_2890116921_7	Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other baseline methods in terms of stable and safe control of cars.
G06.2	self driving	2805209921	G06.2_2805209921_1	A significant problem of using deep learning techniques is the limited amount of data available for training.
G06.2	self driving	2805209921	G06.2_2805209921_2	There are some datasets available for the popular problems like item recognition and classification for self-driving cars, however, it is very limited for the industrial robotics field.
G06.2	self driving	2805209921	G06.2_2805209921_3	In previous work, we have trained a multi-objective Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify the robot body in the image and estimate 3D positions of the joints by using just a 2D image, but it was limited to a range of robots produced by Universal Robots (UR).
G06.2	self driving	2805209921	G06.2_2805209921_4	In this work, we extend our method to work with a new robot arm - Kuka LBR iiwa, which has a significantly different appearance and an additional joint.
G06.2	self driving	2805209921	G06.2_2805209921_5	However, instead of collecting large datasets once again, we collect a number of smaller datasets containing a few hundred frames each and use transfer learning techniques on the CNN trained on UR robots to adapt it to a new robot having different shapes and visual features.
G06.2	self driving	2805209921	G06.2_2805209921_6	We have proven that transfer learning is not only applicable in this field, but it requires smaller well-prepared training datasets, trains significantly faster and reaches similar accuracy compared to the original method, even improving it on some aspects.
G06.2	self driving	2897082611	G06.2_2897082611_1	Moral responsibility is a major concern in automated decision-making, with applications ranging from self-driving cars to kidney exchanges.
G06.2	self driving	855132903	G06.2_855132903_1	In this paper we present queueing-theoretical methods for the modeling, analysis, and control of autonomous mobility-on-demand MOD systems wherein robotic, self-driving vehicles transport customers within an urban environment and rebalance themselves to ensure acceptable quality of service throughout the network.
G06.2	self driving	855132903	G06.2_855132903_2	We first cast an autonomous MOD system within a closed Jackson network model with passenger loss.
G06.2	self driving	855132903	G06.2_855132903_3	The theoretical insights are used to design a robust, real-time rebalancing algorithm, which is applied to a case study of New York City and implemented on an eight-vehicle mobile robot testbed.
G06.2	self driving	855132903	G06.2_855132903_4	The case study of New York shows that the current taxi demand in Manhattan can be met with about 8,000 robotic vehicles roughly 70% of the size of the current taxi fleet operating in Manhattan.
G06.2	self driving	855132903	G06.2_855132903_5	Finally, we extend our queueing-theoretical setup to include congestion effects, and study the impact of autonomously rebalancing vehicles on overall congestion.
G06.2	self driving	855132903	G06.2_855132903_6	Collectively, this paper provides a rigorous approach to the problem of system-wide coordination of autonomously driving vehicles, and provides one of the first characterizations of the sustainability benefits of robotic transportation networks.
G06.2	self driving	602340265	G06.2_602340265_1	In the wake of the on-going digital revolution, we will see a dramatic transformation of our economy and most of our societal institutions.
G06.2	self driving	602340265	G06.2_602340265_2	While the benefits of this transformation can be massive, there are also tremendous risks to our society.
G06.2	self driving	602340265	G06.2_602340265_3	After the automation of many production processes and the creation of self-driving vehicles, the automation of society is next.
G06.2	self driving	602340265	G06.2_602340265_4	This is moving us to a tipping point and to a crossroads: we must decide between a society in which the actions are determined in a top-down way and then implemented by coercion or manipulative technologies (such as personalized ads and nudging) or a society, in which decisions are taken in a free and participatory way and mutually coordinated.
G06.2	self driving	602340265	G06.2_602340265_5	Modern information and communication systems (ICT) enable both, but the latter has economic and strategic benefits.
G06.2	self driving	602340265	G06.2_602340265_6	The fundaments of human dignity, autonomous decision-making, and democracies are shaking, but I believe that they need to be vigorously defended, as they are not only core principles of livable societies, but also the basis of greater efficiency and success.
G06.2	self driving	2895666646	G06.2_2895666646_1	Once self-driving car becomes a reality and passengers are no longer worry about it, they will need to find new ways of entertainment.
G06.2	self driving	2895666646	G06.2_2895666646_2	However, retrieving entertainment contents at the Data Center (DC) can hinder content delivery service due to high delay of car-to-DC communication.
G06.2	self driving	2895666646	G06.2_2895666646_3	To address these challenges, we propose a deep learning based caching for self-driving car, by using Deep Learning approaches deployed on the Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) structure.
G06.2	self driving	2895666646	G06.2_2895666646_4	First, at DC, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is used to predict the probabilities of contents to be requested in specific areas.
G06.2	self driving	2895666646	G06.2_2895666646_5	To reduce the car-DC delay, MLP outputs are logged into MEC servers attached to roadside units.
G06.2	self driving	2895666646	G06.2_2895666646_6	Second, in order to cache entertainment contents stylized for car passengers’ features such as age and gender, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to predict age and gender of passengers.
G06.2	self driving	2895666646	G06.2_2895666646_7	Through this, the self-driving car can identify the contents need to be downloaded from the MEC server and cached.
G06.2	self driving	2895666646	G06.2_2895666646_8	Finally, we formulate deep learning based caching in the self-driving car that enhances entertainment services as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize content downloading delay.
G06.2	self driving	2895666646	G06.2_2895666646_9	To solve the formulated problem, a Block Successive Majorization-Minimization (BS-MM) technique is applied.
G06.2	self driving	2895666646	G06.2_2895666646_10	The simulation results show that the accuracy of our prediction for the contents need to be cached in the areas of the self-driving car is achieved at 98.04% and our approach can minimize delay.
G06.2	self driving	2891558151	G06.2_2891558151_1	This paper describes the design, implementation, and successful use of the Bristol Stock Exchange (BSE), a novel minimal simulation of a centralised financial market, based on a Limit Order Book (LOB) such as is common in major stock exchanges.
G06.2	self driving	2891558151	G06.2_2891558151_2	Construction of BSE was motivated by the fact that most of the world’s major financial markets have automated, with trading activity that previously was the responsibility of human traders now being performed by high-speed autonomous automated trading systems.
G06.2	self driving	2891558151	G06.2_2891558151_3	Research aimed at understanding the dynamics of this new style of financial market is hampered by the fact that no operational real-world exchange is ever likely to allow experimental probing of that market while it is open and running live, forcing researchers to work primarily from time-series of past trading data.
G06.2	self driving	2891558151	G06.2_2891558151_4	Similarly, university-level education of the engineers who can create next-generation automated trading systems requires that they have hands-on learning experience in a sufficiently realistic teaching environment.
G06.2	self driving	2891558151	G06.2_2891558151_5	BSE as described here addresses both those needs: it has been successfully used for teaching and research in a leading UK university since 2012, and the BSE program code is freely available as open-source on GitHuB.
G06.2	self driving	2801562232	G06.2_2801562232_1	This paper provides a holistic study of how stock prices vary in their response to financial disclosures across different topics.
G06.2	self driving	2801562232	G06.2_2801562232_2	Thereby, we specifically shed light into the extensive amount of filings for which no a priori categorization of their content exists.
G06.2	self driving	2801562232	G06.2_2801562232_3	For this purpose, we utilize an approach from data mining - namely, latent Dirichlet allocation - as a means of topic modeling.
G06.2	self driving	2801562232	G06.2_2801562232_4	This technique facilitates our task of automatically categorizing, ex ante, the content of more than 70,000 regulatory 8-K filings from U.S. companies.
G06.2	self driving	2801562232	G06.2_2801562232_5	We then evaluate the subsequent stock market reaction.
G06.2	self driving	2801562232	G06.2_2801562232_6	Our empirical evidence suggests a considerable discrepancy among various types of news stories in terms of their relevance and impact on financial markets.
G06.2	self driving	2801562232	G06.2_2801562232_7	For instance, we find a statistically significant abnormal return in response to earnings results and credit rating, but also for disclosures regarding business strategy, the health sector, as well as mergers and acquisitions.
G06.2	self driving	2801562232	G06.2_2801562232_8	Our results yield findings that benefit managers, investors and policy-makers by indicating how regulatory filings should be structured and the topics most likely to precede changes in stock valuations.
G06.2	self driving	835365303	G06.2_835365303_1	This paper addresses the financial markets problem space with particular emphasis on trading systems seen in banking today.
G06.2	self driving	835365303	G06.2_835365303_2	With the advent of modern computing, cross-regional trading transactions can now be executed within milliseconds, a reality that is impossible without the advancements of software systems technology.
G06.2	self driving	835365303	G06.2_835365303_3	We then move on and discuss the anatomy of a trading system and how it fits in with the banks ecosystem of vital inter-working components.
G06.2	self driving	2888477402	G06.2_2888477402_1	As for the humanoid robots, the internal noise, which is generated by motors, fans and mechanical components when the robot is moving or shaking its body, severely degrades the performance of the speech recognition accuracy.
G06.2	self driving	2888477402	G06.2_2888477402_2	In this paper, a novel speech recognition system robust to ego-noise for humanoid robots is proposed, in which on/off state of the motor is employed as auxiliary information for finding the relevant input features.
G06.2	self driving	2888477402	G06.2_2888477402_3	For this, we consider the bottleneck features, which have been successfully applied to deep neural network (DNN) based automatic speech recognition (ASR) system.
G06.2	self driving	2888477402	G06.2_2888477402_4	When learning the bottleneck features to catch, we first exploit the motor on/off state data as supplementary information in addition to the acoustic features as the input of the first deep neural network (DNN) for preliminary acoustic modeling.
G06.2	self driving	2888477402	G06.2_2888477402_5	Then, the second DNN for primary acoustic modeling employs both the bottleneck features tossed from the first DNN and the acoustics features.
G06.2	self driving	2888477402	G06.2_2888477402_6	When the proposed method is evaluated in terms of phoneme error rate (PER) on TIMIT database, the experimental results show that achieve obvious improvement (11% relative) is achieved by our algorithm over the conventional systems.
G06.2	self driving	89451762	G06.2_89451762_1	Many model based techniques have been proposed in the literature for applying domestic service tasks on humanoid robots, such as teleoperation, learning from demonstration and imitation.
G06.2	self driving	89451762	G06.2_89451762_2	However sensor based robot control overcomes many of the difficulties of uncertain models and unknown environments which limit the domain of application of the previous methods.
G06.2	self driving	89451762	G06.2_89451762_3	Furthermore, for service and manipulation tasks, it is more suitable to study the interaction between the robot and its environment at the contact point using the sensor based control, rather than specifying the joint positions and velocities required to achieve them.
G07.1	misinformation	2888100547	G07.1_2888100547_1	Online social media provide users with unprecedented opportunities to engage with diverse opinions.
G07.1	misinformation	2888100547	G07.1_2888100547_2	Simultaneously, they allow the spread of misinformation by empowering individuals to self-select the narratives they want to be exposed to, both through active (confirmation bias) and passive (personalized news algorithms) self-reinforcing mechanisms.
G07.1	misinformation	2888100547	G07.1_2888100547_3	A precise theoretical understanding of such trade-offs is still largely missing.
G07.1	misinformation	2888100547	G07.1_2888100547_4	We introduce a stylized social learning model where most participants in a network update their beliefs unbiasedly based on the arrival of new information, while a fraction of participants display confirmation bias, enabling them to reject news that are incongruent with their pre-existing beliefs.
G07.1	misinformation	2888100547	G07.1_2888100547_5	We show that this simple confirmation bias mechanism can generate permanent opinion polarisation.
G07.1	misinformation	2888100547	G07.1_2888100547_6	"Furthermore, the model results in states where unbiased agents behave ""as if"" they were biased, due to their biased neighbours effectively functioning as gatekeepers, restricting their access to free and diverse information."
G07.1	misinformation	2888100547	G07.1_2888100547_7	We derive analytic results for the distribution of individual agents’ beliefs, explicitly demonstrating the aforementioned trade-off between confirmation bias and social connectivity, which we further validate against US county-level data on the impact of Internet access on the formation of beliefs about global warming.
G07.1	misinformation	2888100547	G07.1_2888100547_8	Our findings indicate that confirmation bias in small doses may actually result in improved accuracy across individuals by preserving information diversity in a social network.
G07.1	misinformation	2888100547	G07.1_2888100547_9	However, results also indicate that when confirmation bias grows past an optimal value, accuracy declines as biased agents restrict information flow to subgroups.
G07.1	misinformation	2888100547	G07.1_2888100547_10	We discuss the policy implications of our model, highlighting the downside of debunking strategies and suggesting alternative strategies to contrast misinformation.
G07.1	misinformation	2803622358	G07.1_2803622358_1	The advent of WWW changed the way we can produce and access information.
G07.1	misinformation	2803622358	G07.1_2803622358_2	Recent studies showed that users tend to select information that is consistent with their system of beliefs, forming polarized groups of like-minded people around shared narratives where dissenting information is ignored.
G07.1	misinformation	2803622358	G07.1_2803622358_3	In this environment, users cooperate to frame and reinforce their shared narrative making any attempt at debunking inefficient.
G07.1	misinformation	2803622358	G07.1_2803622358_4	Such a configuration occurs even in the consumption of news online, and considering that 63% of users access news directly form social media, one hypothesis is that more polarization allows for further spreading of misinformation.
G07.1	misinformation	2803622358	G07.1_2803622358_5	Along this path, we focus on the polarization of users around news outlets on Facebook in different European countries (Italy, France, Spain and Germany).
G07.1	misinformation	2803622358	G07.1_2803622358_6	First, we compare the page posting behavior and the users interacting patterns across countries and observe different posting, liking and commenting rates.
G07.1	misinformation	2803622358	G07.1_2803622358_7	Second, we explore the tendency of users to interact with different pages (i.e., selective exposure) and the emergence of polarized communities generated around specific pages.
G07.1	misinformation	2803622367	G07.1_2803622367_1	We find that Italy is the most polarized country, followed by France, Germany and lastly Spain.
G07.1	misinformation	2803622367	G07.1_2803622367_2	Finally, we present a variation of the Bounded Confidence Model to simulate the emergence of these communities by considering the usersu0027 engagement and trust on the news.
G07.1	misinformation	2803622367	G07.1_2803622367_3	Our findings suggest that trust in information broadcaster plays a pivotal role against polarization of users online.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2898599358	G08.1_2898599358_1	For decentralised P2P networks, it is very important to have a mechanism in place that allows the nodes to control resource usage and prevent flooding and denial-of-service attacks with spam.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2898599358	G08.1_2898599358_2	In this paper, we discuss and compare the different approaches to fully decentralised resource control that are used by projects in the cryptocurrency space.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2898599358	G08.1_2898599358_3	The introduced methods are then applied to design a decentralised exchange for Namecoin names (or more generally, crypto assets) as an example.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2889349357	G08.1_2889349357_1	With the introduction of memory-bound cryptocurrencies, such as Monero, the implementation of mining code in browser-based JavaScript has become a worthwhile alternative to dedicated mining rigs.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2889349357	G08.1_2889349357_2	Based on this technology, a new form of parasitic computing, widely called cryptojacking or drive-by mining, has gained momentum in the web. A cryptojacking site abuses the computing resources of its visitors to covertly mine for cryptocurrencies.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2889349357	G08.1_2889349357_3	In this paper, we systematically explore this phenomenon. For this, we propose a 3-phase analysis approach, which enables us to identify mining scripts and conduct a large-scale study on the prevalence of cryptojacking in the Alexa 1 million websites.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2889349357	G08.1_2889349357_4	We find that cryptojacking is common, with currently 1 out of 500 sites hosting a mining script.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2889349357	G08.1_2889349357_5	Moreover, we perform several secondary analyses to gain insight into the cryptojacking landscape, including a measurement of code characteristics, an estimate of expected mining revenue, and an evaluation of current blacklist-based countermeasures.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2889740224	G08.1_2889740224_1	The rise of modern blockchains has facilitated the emergence of smart contracts: autonomous programs that live and run on the blockchain.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2889740224	G08.1_2889740224_2	"Smart contracts have seen a rapid climb to prominence, with applications predicted in law, business, commerce, and governance.  contracts :[39],""are commonly written in a high-level language such as Ethereumu0027s Solidity, and translated to compact low-level bytecode for deployment on the blockchain."
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2889740224	G08.1_2889740224_3	Once deployed, the bytecode is autonomously executed, usually by a %Turing-complete virtual machine.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2889740224	G08.1_2889740224_4	As with all programs, smart contracts can be highly vulnerable to malicious attacks due to deficient programming methodologies, languages, and toolchains, including buggy compilers.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2889740224	G08.1_2889740224_5	"At the same time, smart contracts :[39],""are also high-value targets, often commanding large amounts of cryptocurrency."
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2889740224	G08.1_2889740224_6	Hence, developers and auditors need security frameworks capable of analysing low-level bytecode to detect potential security vulnerabilities.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2889740224	G08.1_2889740224_7	In this paper, we present Vandal: a security analysis framework for Ethereum smart contracts.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2889740224	G08.1_2889740224_8	Vandal consists of an analysis pipeline that converts low-level Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode to semantic logic relations.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2889740224	G08.1_2889740224_9	Users of the framework can express security analyses in a declarative fashion: a security analysis is expressed in a logic specification written in the \souffle language.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2889740235	G08.1_2889740235_1	Vandal is both fast and robust, successfully analysing over 95\% of all 141k unique contracts with an average runtime of 4.15 seconds; outperforming the current state of the art tools---Oyente, EthIR, Mythril, and Rattle---under equivalent conditions.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2895247503	G08.1_2895247503_1	As Bitcoinu0027s popularity has grown over the decade since its creation, it has become an increasingly attractive target for adversaries of all kinds.
G09.1	forensics	754200012	G09.1_754200012_1	Image tampering, being readily facilitated and proliferated by today’s digital techniques, is increasingly causing problems regarding the authenticity of images.
G09.1	forensics	754200012	G09.1_754200012_2	As the most popular multimedia data, JPEG images can be easily tampered without leaving any clues; therefore, JPEG-based forensics , including the detection of double compression, interpolation, rotation, etc., has become an active research topic in multimedia forensics.
G09.1	forensics	754200012	G09.1_754200012_3	Nevertheless, the interesting issue of detecting image tampering and its related operations by using the same quantization matrix has not been fully investigated.
G09.1	forensics	754200012	G09.1_754200012_4	Aiming to detect such forgery manipulations under the same quantization matrix, we propose a detection method by using shift-recompression -based reshuffle characteristic features.
G09.1	forensics	754200012	G09.1_754200012_5	The learning classifiers are applied for classification.
G09.1	forensics	754200012	G09.1_754200012_6	Our experimental results indicate that the approach is indeed highly effective in detecting image tampering and relevant manipulations with the same quantization matrix.
G09.1	forensics	567125047	G09.1_567125047_1	The malicious alteration of machine time is a big challenge in computer forensics.
G09.1	forensics	567125047	G09.1_567125047_2	Detecting such changes and reconstructing the actual timeline of events is of paramount importance.
G09.1	forensics	567125047	G09.1_567125047_3	However, this can be difficult since the attacker has many opportunities and means to hide such changes.
G09.1	forensics	567125047	G09.1_567125047_4	In particular, cloud computing, host and guest machine time can be manipulated in various ways by an attacker.
G09.1	forensics	567125047	G09.1_567125047_5	Guest virtual machines are especially vulnerable to attacks coming from their (more privileged) host.
G09.1	forensics	567125047	G09.1_567125047_6	As such, it is important to guarantee the timeline integrity of both hosts and guests in a cloud, or at least to ensure that the alteration of such timeline does not go undetected.
G09.1	forensics	567125047	G09.1_567125047_7	In this paper we survey the issues related to host and guest machine time integrity in the cloud.
G09.1	forensics	567125047	G09.1_567125047_8	Further, we describe a novel architecture for host and guest time alteration detection and correction/resilience with respect to compromised hosts and guests.
G09.1	forensics	567125047	G09.1_567125047_9	The proposed framework has been implemented on an especially built simulator.
G09.1	forensics	567125047	G09.1_567125047_10	Performance figures show the feasibility of our proposal.
G09.1	forensics	2885025643	G09.1_2885025643_1	Detection of different types of image editing operations carried out on an image is an important problem in image forensics.
G09.1	forensics	2885025643	G09.1_2885025643_2	It gives the information about the processing history of an image, and also can expose forgeries present in an image.
G09.1	forensics	2885025643	G09.1_2885025643_3	There have been a few methods proposed to detect different types of image editing operations in a single framework.
G09.1	forensics	2885025643	G09.1_2885025643_4	However, all the operations have to be known a priori in the training phase.
G09.1	forensics	2885025643	G09.1_2885025643_5	But, in real-forensics scenarios it may not be possible to know about the editing operations carried out on an image.
G09.1	forensics	2885025643	G09.1_2885025643_6	To solve this problem, we propose a novel deep learning-based method which can differentiate between different types of image editing operations.
G09.1	forensics	2885025643	G09.1_2885025643_7	The proposed method classifies image patches in a pair-wise fashion as either similarly or differently processed using a deep siamese neural network.
G09.1	forensics	2885025643	G09.1_2885025643_8	Once the network learns feature that can discriminate between different image editing operations, it can differentiate between different image editing operations not present in the training stage.
G09.1	forensics	2885025643	G09.1_2885025643_9	The experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed method in detecting/discriminating different image editing operations.
G01.1	Digital assistant	2797641221	G01.1_2797641221_1	Digital assistants are emerging to become more prevalent in our daily lives. In interacting with these assistants, users may engage in multiple tasks within a short period of time.
G01.1	Digital assistant	2463945949	G01.1_2463945949_1	DIANE is a digital assistant system that aims to fasten the doctor access to various informations at the hospital such as health care facility, medical records, and also human resource data. The fasten access could be achieved by implementing face recognition and live streaming as part of the digital assistant system.
G01.2	Biases	1448624402	G01.2_1448624402_1	As extensive experimental research has shown individuals suffer from diverse biases in decision-making.
G01.2	Biases	1448624402	G01.2_1448624402_2	In our paper we analyze the effects of decision-making biases of managers in collaborative decision processes on organizational performance.
G01.2	Biases	1448624402	G01.2_1448624402_3	In the simulations, managerial decisions which are based on different levels of organizational complexity and different incentive systems suffer from biases known from descriptive decision theory.
G01.2	Biases	1448624402	G01.2_1448624402_4	The results illustrate how biases in combination with each other and in different organizational contexts affect organizational performance.
G01.2	Biases	1448624402	G01.2_1448624402_5	We find that, contrary to intuition, some combinations of biases significantly improve organizational performance while these biases negatively affect organizational performance when they occur separately.
G01.2	Biases	1448624402	G01.2_1448624402_6	This might evoke considerations whether decision-making should be as rational as possible.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2968701259	G10.1_2968701259_1	Perception of the local environment is a precondition for mobile robots to navigate safely in dynamic environments.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2968701259	G10.1_2968701259_2	Most robots, i.e., humanoids and smaller wheeled robots rely on planar regions.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2968701259	G10.1_2968701259_3	For humanoids, a simple 2D occupancy map as environment representation on which a path is planned is hereby not sufficient since they can step over and onto objects and therefore need height information.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2968701259	G10.1_2968701259_4	Considering dynamic obstacles introduces another level of complexity, since they can lead to necessary replanning or collisions at later stages.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2968701259	G10.1_2968701259_5	In this paper, we present a framework that first extracts planar regions in height maps and detects dynamic obstacles.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2968701259	G10.1_2968701259_6	Our system then uses this information to create a set of prediction maps, in which paths can be efficiently planned in real time at low CPU cost.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2968701259	G10.1_2968701259_7	We show in simulation and real-world experiments that our framework keeps run times well under 10ms for one computation cycle and allows for foresighted real-time 3D footstep planning.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2906808597	G10.1_2906808597_1	An autonomous service robot often first has to search for a user to carry out a desired task.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2906808597	G10.1_2906808597_2	This is a challenging problem, especially when this person moves around since the robot’s field of view is constrained and the environment structure typically poses further visibility constraints that influence the perception of the user.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2906808597	G10.1_2906808597_3	In this paper, we propose a novel method that computes the likelihood of the user’s observability at each possible location in the environment based on Monte Carlo simulations.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2906808597	G10.1_2906808597_4	As the robot needs time to reach the possible search locations, we take this time as well as the visibility constraints into account when computing effective search locations.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2906808597	G10.1_2906808597_5	In this way, the robot can choose the next search location that has the maximum expected observability of the user.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2906808597	G10.1_2906808597_6	Our experiments in various simulated environments demonstrate that our approach leads to a significantly shorter search time compared to a greedy approach with background information.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2773777794	G10.1_2773777794_1	In many situations, users walk on typical paths between specific destinations at which the service of a mobile robot is needed.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2773777794	G10.1_2773777794_2	Depending on the environment and the paths, step-by-step following of the human might not be the optimal solution since better paths for the robot exist.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2773777794	G10.1_2773777794_3	We propose to perform a prediction about the human's future movements and use this information in a reinforcement learning framework to generate foresighted navigation actions for the robot.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2773777794	G10.1_2773777794_4	Since frequent occlusions of the human will occur due to obstacles and the robot's constrained field of view, the estimate about the humans's position and the prediction of the next destination are affected by uncertainty.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2773777794	G10.1_2773777794_5	Our approach deals with such situations by explicitly considering occlusions in the reward function such that the robot automatically considers to execute actions to get the human in its field of view.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2773777794	G10.1_2773777794_6	We show in simulated and real-world experiments that our technique leads to significantly shorter paths compared to an approach in which the robot always tries to closely follow the user and, additionally, can handle occlusions.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2562908749	G10.1_2562908749_1	In this paper, we introduce an approach to efficient robot navigation through cluttered indoor environments.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2562908749	G10.1_2562908749_2	We propose to estimate local obstacle densities based on already detected objects and use them to predict traversal costs corresponding to potential obstacles in regions not yet observable by the robot's sensors.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2562908749	G10.1_2562908749_3	By taking into account the predicted costs for path planning, the robot is then able to navigate in a more foresighted manner and reduces the risk of getting stuck in cluttered regions.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2562908749	G10.1_2562908749_4	As the experimental results demonstrate, our method enables the robot to efficiently navigate through environments containing cluttered regions and achieves significantly shorter completion times compared to a standard approach not using any prediction.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2093013061	G10.1_2093013061_1	In this paper, we present an integrated navigation system that allows humanoid robots to autonomously navigate in unknown, cluttered environments.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2093013061	G10.1_2093013061_2	From the data of an onboard consumer-grade depth camera, our system estimates the robot's pose to compensate for drift of odometry and maintains a heightmap representation of the environment.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2093013061	G10.1_2093013061_3	Based on this model, our system iteratively computes sequences of safe actions including footsteps and whole-body motions, leading the robot to target locations.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2093013061	G10.1_2093013061_4	To efficiently check for collisions during planning, we developed a new approach that takes into account the shape of the robot and the obstacles.
G10.1	humanoid robots	2093013061	G10.1_2093013061_5	As we demonstrate in experiments with a Nao humanoid, our system leads to robust navigation in cluttered environments and the robot is able to traverse highly challenging passages.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1593729956	G10.1_1593729956_1	In this paper, we present a novel approach to accurately calibrate the kinematic model of a humanoid based on observations of its monocular camera.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1593729956	G10.1_1593729956_2	Our technique estimates the parameters of the complete model, consisting of the joint angle offsets of the whole body including the legs, as well as the camera extrinsic and intrinsic parameters.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1593729956	G10.1_1593729956_3	Furthermore, we developed an approach to automatically select a subset of configurations for the calibration process that yields a good trade-off between the number of observations and accuracy.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1593729956	G10.1_1593729956_4	Further, our approach to configuration selection yields substantially better optimization results compared to randomly chosen viable configurations.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1593729956	G10.1_1593729956_5	Hence, our system only requires a reduced number of configurations to achieve accurate results.
G10.1	humanoid robots	1593729956	G10.1_1593729956_6	Our optimization is general and the implementation, which is available online, can easily be applied to different humanoids.
G11.1	drones	2794850674	G11.1_2794850674_1	In this paper, a lab automation drone notional concept is introduced.
G11.1	drones	2794850674	G11.1_2794850674_2	Here, a robotic limb is attached to a robotic rotorcraft.
G11.1	drones	2794850674	G11.1_2794850674_3	The limb's gripper allows the unmanned aerial vehicle to dexterously manipulate objects such as micro-arrays and test tubes often used in high throughput systems (HTS).
G11.1	drones	2794850674	G11.1_2794850674_4	The resulting drone could augment existing HTS operations.
G11.1	drones	2794850674	G11.1_2794850674_5	The 6 degree-of-freedom (DOF) arm and gripper design are presented.
G11.1	drones	2794850674	G11.1_2794850674_6	Test-and-evaluation approach and results are also given.
G11.1	drones	2795365350	G11.1_2795365350_1	Robot companionship has become more popular in past years.
G11.1	drones	2795365350	G11.1_2795365350_2	However, humanoid gait might be somewhat unstable for these applications.
G11.1	drones	2795365350	G11.1_2795365350_3	Even with miniature humanoids, falls occur frequently.
G11.1	drones	2795365350	G11.1_2795365350_4	Thus, wheel attachments have been added onto a miniature humanoid, so it can move faster and with more stability than walking.
G11.1	drones	2795365350	G11.1_2795365350_5	In addition, with such attachments a robot can switch from walking to rolling when necessary.
G11.1	drones	2795365350	G11.1_2795365350_6	DARwIn-OP is a humanoid robot that has been used as an experimentation and performance evaluation platform.
G11.1	drones	2795365350	G11.1_2795365350_7	This paper discusses preliminary work regarding robot companionship applications by using a miniature humanoid capable of fetching different toys based on voice command.
G11.1	drones	2946157960	G11.1_2946157960_1	Advances in electronics and sensor technology have widened the scopes of networked drones to include applications as diverse as surveillance, video recording, operations, entertainment/advertising, signal emission, transportation, and delivery.
G11.1	drones	2946157960	G11.1_2946157960_2	These applications and services require video recording for their operations.
G11.1	drones	2946157960	G11.1_2946157960_3	Large drones are used singly in missions while small ones are used in formations or swarms.
G11.1	drones	2946157960	G11.1_2946157960_4	The small drones are proving to be useful in civilian applications.
G11.1	drones	2946157960	G11.1_2946157960_5	Consideration of small drones for the applications such as group flight, entertainment, and signal emission lead to deployment of networked drones.
G11.1	drones	2946157960	G11.1_2946157960_6	To develop group display applications, a real-time drone formation control for group display is proposed.
G11.1	drones	2946157960	G11.1_2946157960_7	Simulation shows that drone formation can display messages effectively.
G13.1	digital marketing	3004169763	G13.1_3004169763_1	The prevalence and rapid development of the Internet and mobile technology in recent decades has revamped our living styles and daily habits.
G13.1	digital marketing	3004169763	G13.1_3004169763_2	To ride on the digital trend, more business activities have been engaged in the digital world.
G13.1	digital marketing	3004169763	G13.1_3004169763_3	Marketing and advertising is one of typical business areas that is transformed digitally.
G13.1	digital marketing	3004169763	G13.1_3004169763_4	The rise of Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs), social media platforms, and Omni-channel retailing have attracted countless business entities to consider the adoption of digital marketing tools for promoting and advertising their brands and products.
G13.1	digital marketing	3004169763	G13.1_3004169763_5	However, with the increasing diversity of the types of digital marketing tools, they must be carefully selected based on a multiple number of criterion.
G13.1	digital marketing	3004169763	G13.1_3004169763_6	In this paper, a fuzzy-AHP method is proposed and developed for assisting industry practitioners in systematically and effectively evaluate and select proper digital marketing tool(s) for adoption.
G13.1	digital marketing	3004169763	G13.1_3004169763_7	The developed method not only streamlines the internal business process of digital marketing tool selection, but it also increases the practitioner's effectiveness of achieving the pre-defined strategic marketing objectives.
G13.1	digital marketing	2570453702	G13.1_2570453702_1	This study focuses on the digital marketing capabilities of tourism SMEs.
G13.1	digital marketing	2570453702	G13.1_2570453702_2	The study addresses the question of how the use of ICT-based tools benefit the organisational capabilities of a company.
G13.1	digital marketing	2570453702	G13.1_2570453702_3	By adopting marketing as a set-of-skills approach, the study provides new insights into the existing tourism literature on e-marketing.
G13.1	digital marketing	2570453702	G13.1_2570453702_4	Initial findings indicate that the digital marketing capabilities of companies are transformed through ICT-based uptake.
G13.1	digital marketing	2570453702	G13.1_2570453702_5	Four major capabilities were identified, each of which evolves as a result of using the tools.
G13.1	digital marketing	2570453702	G13.1_2570453702_6	A key finding of the study is that the use of ICT-based tools transforms digital marketing capabilities from a set of abilities that enables tourism SMEs not only to float in a web-marketing stream, but also to lead such a stream.
G02.2	Privacy	2134216589	G02.2_2134216589_1	Big data, the enhanced ability to collect, store and analyze previously unimaginable quantities of data in tremendous speed and with negligible costs, delivers immense benefits in marketing efficiency, healthcare, environmental protection, national security and more.
G02.2	Privacy	2134216589	G02.2_2134216589_2	The central tenets of the current privacy framework, the principles of data minimization and purpose limitation, are severely strained by the big data technological and business reality.
G02.2	Privacy	2134216589	G02.2_2134216589_3	As we increasingly interact with these artificial agents in unsupervised settings, with no human mediators, their seeming autonomy and increasingly sophisticated functionality and behavior, raises legal and philosophical questions.
G02.2	Privacy	2134216589	G02.2_2134216589_4	The focus on the machine is a distraction from the debate surrounding data driven ethical dilemmas, such as privacy, fairness and discrimination.
G02.2	Privacy	2134216589	G02.2_2134216589_5	The machine may exacerbate, enable, or simply draw attention to the ethical challenges, but it is humans who must be held accountable.
G02.2	Privacy	2134216589	G02.2_2134216589_6	Policymakers should seek to devise agreed-upon guidelines for ethical data analysis and profiling.
G02.2	Privacy	2134216589	G02.2_2134216589_7	Such guidelines would address the use of legal and technical mechanisms to obfuscate data; criteria for calling out unethical, if not illegal, behavior; categories of privacy and non-privacy harms; and strategies for empowering individuals through access to data in intelligible form.
G03.1	smart speaker	2960901639	G03.1_2960901639_1	As smart speakers with voice interaction capability permeate continuously in the world, more and more people will gradually get used to the new interaction medium–voice.
G03.1	smart speaker	2960901639	G03.1_2960901639_2	Although speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP) have been greatly improved over the past few years, users still may encounter errors from time to time like “cannot understand”, “no requested audio resource (such as music)”, which can frustrate users.
G03.1	smart speaker	2960901639	G03.1_2960901639_3	Therefore, when an error message is reported, it is vital that the smart speaker gives an effective and proper response.
G03.1	smart speaker	2960901639	G03.1_2960901639_4	However, currently the response strategies adopted by leading smart speaker brands in China differed mainly on two dimensions: “apology or not” and “humor or neutral”.
G03.1	smart speaker	2960901639	G03.1_2960901639_5	We explored user’s preference of response strategies under two error scenarios——“cannot understand” and “no requested audio resource”.
G03.1	smart speaker	2960901639	G03.1_2960901639_6	Two dependent variables (satisfaction and perceived sincerity of response) were measured.
G03.1	smart speaker	2960901639	G03.1_2960901639_7	The results showed that participants were more satisfied and perceived higher sincerity when smart speaker apologized in both error scenarios.
G03.1	smart speaker	2960901639	G03.1_2960901639_8	In the “no requested audio resource” scenario, humor had no significant impact on the perception of satisfaction and sincerity.
G03.1	smart speaker	2960901639	G03.1_2960901639_9	But in the “cannot understand” scenario, humorous expression decreased perceived sincerity.
G03.1	smart speaker	2949291273	G03.1_2949291273_1	the smart speakers cannot distinguish human voice from machine voice.
G03.1	smart speaker	2949291273	G03.1_2949291273_2	a method to identify which of human or machine is sending voice commands to a smart speaker is desired.
G03.1	smart speaker	2949291273	G03.1_2949291273_3	to prevent such machine-voice based attacks to a smart speaker in absence of residents, we propose a system consisting of a speaker and a microphone array to detect the existence of a human nearby, supposing it can be incorporated in a smart speaker in the future.
G03.1	smart speaker	2943753439	G03.1_2943753439_1	Amazon's Echo, and Apple's Siri have drawn attention from different user groups; however, these existing commercial VUIs support limited language options for users including native English speakers and non-native English speakers.
G03.1	smart speaker	2943753439	G03.1_2943753439_2	we conducted a usability study of the Google Home Smart Speaker with 20 participants including native English and non-native English speakers to understand their differences in using the Google Home Smart Speaker.
G03.1	smart speaker	2943753439	G03.1_2943753439_3	The findings show that compared with their counterparts, the native English speakers had better and more positive user experiences in interacting with the device.
G03.1	smart speaker	2943753439	G03.1_2943753439_4	It also shows that users' English language proficiency plays an important role in interacting with VUIs.
G03.1	smart speaker	2943753439	G03.1_2943753439_5	The findings from this study can create insights for VUI designers and developers for implementing multiple language options and better voice recognition algorithms in VUIs for different user groups across the world.
G04.1	drug discovery	2214798411	G04.1_2214798411_1	A pharmacophore analysis approach was used to investigate and compare different classes of compounds relevant to the drug discovery process (specifically, drug molecules, compounds in high throughput screening libraries, combinatorial chemistry building blocks and nondrug molecules).
G04.1	drug discovery	2214798411	G04.1_2214798411_2	Significant differences were observed between the pharmacophore profiles obtained for the drug molecules and those obtained for the high-throughput screening compounds, which appear to be closely related to the nondrug pharmacophore distribution.
G04.1	drug discovery	2214798411	G04.1_2214798411_3	It is suggested that the analysis of pharmacophore profiles could be used as an additional tool for the property-based optimization of compound selection and library design processes, thus improving the odds of success in lead discovery projects.
G04.1	drug discovery	2339209416	G04.1_2339209416_1	Annotation of bioassay protocols using semantic web vocabulary is a way to make experiment descriptions machine-readable.
G04.1	drug discovery	2339209416	G04.1_2339209416_2	Protocols are communicated using concise scientific English, which precludes most kinds of analysis by software algorithms.
G04.1	drug discovery	2339209416	G04.1_2339209416_3	Given the availability of a sufficiently expressive ontology, some or all of the pertinent information can be captured by asserting a series of facts, expressed as semantic web triples (subject, predicate, object).
G04.1	drug discovery	2339209416	G04.1_2339209416_4	With appropriate annotation, assays can be searched, clustered, tagged and evaluated in a multitude of ways, analogous to other segments of drug discovery informatics.
G04.1	drug discovery	2339209416	G04.1_2339209416_5	The BioAssay Ontology (BAO) has been previously designed for this express purpose, and provides a layered hierarchy of meaningful terms which can be linked to.
G04.2	functional genomics	2415325177	G04.2_2415325177_1	Next generation sequencing (NGS) produces massive datasets consisting of billions of reads and up to thousands of samples.
G04.2	functional genomics	2415325177	G04.2_2415325177_2	Subsequent bioinformatic analysis is typically done with the help of open source tools, where each application performs a single step towards the final result.
G04.2	functional genomics	2415325177	G04.2_2415325177_3	This situation leaves the bioinformaticians with the tasks to combine the tools, manage the data files and meta-information, document the analysis, and ensure reproducibility.

G04.3	infectious diseases	2941964798	G04.3_2941964798_2	Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has provided a powerful tool in identifying the genetic variation and constructing the correlations between genotype and phenotype in humans and other species.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2941964798	G04.3_2941964798_3	a Bayesian framework for genotype estimation for mixtures of multiple bacteria, named as Genetic Polymorphisms Assignments (GPA) has reduced the false discovery rate (FDR) and mean absolute error (MAE) in single nucleotide variant (SNV) identification.
G05.1	gene editing	2757079914	G05.1_2757079914_1	CRISPR-Cas is a tool that is widely used for gene editing.
G05.1	gene editing	2757079914	G05.1_2757079914_2	However, unexpected off-target effects may occur as a result of long-term nuclease activity.
G05.1	gene editing	2757079914	G05.1_2757079914_3	Anti-CRISPR proteins, which are powerful molecules that inhibit the CRISPR-Cas system, may have the potential to promote better utilization of the CRISPR-Cas system in gene editing, especially for gene therapy.
G05.1	gene editing	2757079914	G05.1_2757079914_4	Additionally, more in-depth research on these proteins would help researchers to better understand the co-evolution of bacteria and phages.
G05.1	gene editing	2757079914	G05.1_2757079914_5	Therefore, it is necessary to collect and integrate data on various types of anti-CRISPRs.
G05.1	gene editing	2117924928	G05.1_2117924928_1	The CRISPR/Cas9 system was recently developed as a powerful and flexible technology for targeted genome engineering, including genome editing (altering the genetic sequence) and gene regulation (without altering the genetic sequence).
G05.1	gene editing	2117924928	G05.1_2117924928_2	These applications require the design of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) that are efficient and specific.
G05.1	gene editing	2117924928	G05.1_2117924928_3	However, this remains challenging, as it requires the consideration of many criteria.
G05.1	gene editing	2914002216	G05.1_2914002216_1	CRISPR has become a hot research area ever since its advent for its efficiency and specificity in editing almost every section of DNA sequences.
G05.1	gene editing	2914002216	G05.1_2914002216_2	Based on its function of gene perturbation, a variety of gene editing techniques have been developed to achieve different aims.
G05.1	gene editing	2914002216	G05.1_2914002216_3	The target locations of a DNA strain can be precisely broken and repaired, during which the genes can be removed, repaired, silenced, or activated.
G05.1	gene editing	2914002216	G05.1_2914002216_4	The high efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9 reagents preparation and the easiness of experiment conduction make it now a powerful tool of high-content screen.
G05.1	gene editing	2584932255	G05.1_2584932255_1	The hidden connection between these reports is that gene editing could be used to solve issues related to health care allocation.
G05.1	gene editing	2584932255	G05.1_2584932255_2	Improving the health of future generations might coincide with public health goals; it might improve the health of individuals and communities, and, if successful, might be seen as a public good.
G05.1	gene editing	2584932255	G05.1_2584932255_3	However, enhancing future generations will require In Vitro Fertilisation and Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis.
G05.1	gene editing	2584932255	G05.1_2584932255_4	Remarkably, the necessary involvement of women in an enhancing scenario has not been discussed by its proponents.
G05.1	gene editing	2584932255	G05.1_2584932255_5	The present discourse on moral obligations of future generations, although not referring to women, seems to imply that women might be required, morally, if not legally, to reproduce with IVF.
G05.1	gene editing	2584932255	G05.1_2584932255_6	Enhancing future generations will be gendered, unless the artificial womb is developed.
G05.1	gene editing	2584932255	G05.1_2584932255_7	These are challenging issues that require a wider perspective, of both women and men.
G05.1	gene editing	2584932255	G05.1_2584932255_8	Despite the lack of a unified feminist conclusion in the discussions about the merits and risks of human genome modification, there is an urgent need to clarify the role of women in this scenario.
G05.2	crispr	2796443924	G05.2_2796443924_1	The CRISPR-Cpf1 system has been successfully applied in genome editing.
G05.2	crispr	2796443924	G05.2_2796443924_2	However, target efficiency of the CRISPR-Cpf1 system varies among different gRNA sequences.
G05.2	crispr	2796443924	G05.2_2796443924_3	Using machine learning technology, a SVM model was created to predict target efficiency for any given gRNAs.

G06.2	self driving	2906897310	G06.2_2906897310_1	A key problem for autonomous car navigation is the understanding, at an object level, of the current driving situation.
G06.2	self driving	2906897310	G06.2_2906897310_2	Addressing this issue requires the extraction of meaningful information from on-board stereo imagery by classifying the fundamental elements of urban scenes into semantic categories that can more easily be interpreted and be reflected upon (streets, buildings, pedestrians, vehicles, signs, etc.).
G06.2	self driving	2906897310	G06.2_2906897310_3	A probabilistic method is proposed to fuse a coarse prior 3D map data with stereo imagery classification.
G06.2	self driving	2906897310	G06.2_2906897310_4	A novel fusion architecture based on the Stixel framework is presented for combining semantic pixel-wise segmentation from a convolutional neural network (CNN) with depth information obtained from stereo imagery while integrating coarse prior depth and label information.
G06.2	self driving	2906897310	G06.2_2906897310_5	The proposed approach was tested on a manually labeled data set in urban environments.
G06.2	self driving	2906897310	G06.2_2906897310_6	The results show that the classification accuracy of the fundamental elements composing the urban scene was significantly enhanced by this method compared to what is obtained from the semantic pixel-wise segmentation of a CNN alone.
G06.2	self driving	2968176166	G06.2_2968176166_1	In recent years self-driving vehicles have become more commonplace on public roads, with the promise of bringing safety and efficiency to modern transportation systems.
G06.2	self driving	2968176166	G06.2_2968176166_2	Increasing the reliability of these vehicles on the road requires an extensive suite of software tests, ideally performed on highfidelity simulators, where multiple vehicles and pedestrians interact with the self-driving vehicle.
G06.2	self driving	2968176166	G06.2_2968176166_3	It is therefore of critical importance to ensure that self-driving software is assessed against a wide range of challenging simulated driving scenarios.
G06.2	self driving	2968176166	G06.2_2968176166_4	The state of the art in driving scenario generation, as adopted by some of the front-runners of the self-driving car industry, still relies on human input [1].
G06.2	self driving	2968176166	G06.2_2968176166_5	In this paper we propose to automate the process using Bayesian optimization to generate adversarial self-driving scenarios that expose poorly-engineered or poorly-trained self-driving policies, and increase the risk of collision with simulated pedestrians and vehicles.
G06.2	self driving	2968176166	G06.2_2968176166_6	We show that by incorporating the generated scenarios into the training set of the self-driving policy, and by fine-tuning the policy using vision-based imitation learning we obtain safer self-driving behavior.
G06.2	self driving	2958092349	G06.2_2958092349_1	With the developing of the technology on self-driving, more and more L3 driverless vehicles are launched in market, people get opportunities to experience the self-driving cars in their daily life.
G06.2	self driving	2958092349	G06.2_2958092349_2	As a result, there is a growing demand for the autopilot experience.
G06.2	self driving	2958092349	G06.2_2958092349_3	Natural and efficient human-computer interaction can not only improve the driving experience, but also accelerate the process of self-driving commercialization.
G06.2	self driving	2958092349	G06.2_2958092349_4	This paper discusses eye-movement interaction, voice interaction and gesture interaction in self-driving car, and analyzes the technology, advantages and disadvantages of the existing interaction modes, and prospect the future development trend of self-driving human-computer interaction.
G06.2	self driving	2606555570	G06.2_2606555570_1	Self-driving vehicle technologies are progressing rapidly and are expected to play a significant role in the future of transportation.
G06.2	self driving	2606555570	G06.2_2606555570_2	One of the main challenges for self-driving vehicles on public roads is the safe cooperation and collaboration among multiple vehicles using sensor-based perception and inter-vehicle communications.
G06.2	self driving	2606555570	G06.2_2606555570_3	When self-driving vehicles try to occupy the same spatial area simultaneously, they might collide with one another, might become deadlocked, or might slam on the brakes making it uncomfortable or unsafe for passengers in a self-driving vehicle.
G06.2	self driving	2606555570	G06.2_2606555570_4	In this paper, we study how a self-driving vehicle can safely navigate merge points, where two lanes with different priorities meet.
G06.2	self driving	2606555570	G06.2_2606555570_5	We present a safe protocol for merge points named Autonomous Vehicle Protocol for Merge Points, where self-driving vehicles use both vehicular communications and their own perception systems for cooperating with other self-driving and/or human-driven vehicles.
G06.2	self driving	2606555570	G06.2_2606555570_6	Our simulation results show that our traffic protocol has higher traffic throughput, compared to simple traffic protocols, while ensuring safety.
G06.2	self driving	2548923997	G06.2_2548923997_1	Emerging self-driving vehicles are vulnerable to different attacks due to the principle and the type of communication systems that are used in these vehicles.
G06.2	self driving	2548923997	G06.2_2548923997_2	These vehicles are increasingly relying on external communication via vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs).
G06.2	self driving	2548923997	G06.2_2548923997_3	VANETs add new threats to self-driving vehicles that contribute to substantial challenges in autonomous systems.
G06.2	self driving	2548923997	G06.2_2548923997_4	These communication systems render self-driving vehicles vulnerable to many types of malicious attacks, such as Sybil attacks, Denial of Service (DoS), black hole, grey hole and wormhole attacks.
G06.2	self driving	2548923997	G06.2_2548923997_5	In this paper, we propose an intelligent security system designed to secure external communications for self-driving and semi self-driving cars.
G06.2	self driving	2548923997	G06.2_2548923997_6	The hybrid detection system relies on the Back Propagation neural networks (BP), to detect a common type of attack in VANETs: Denial-of-Service (DoS).
G06.2	self driving	2548923997	G06.2_2548923997_7	The experimental results show that the proposed BP-IDS is capable of identifying malicious vehicles in self-driving and semi self-driving vehicles.
G06.2	self driving	2931522054	G06.2_2931522054_1	This paper proposes a MATLAB/Simulink benchmark suite for an open-source self-driving system based on Robot Operating System (ROS).
G06.2	self driving	2931522054	G06.2_2931522054_2	One approach to the development of self-driving systems is the utilization of ROS which is an open-source middleware framework used in the development of robot applications.
G06.2	self driving	2931522054	G06.2_2931522054_3	On the other hand, the popular approach in the automotive industry is the utilization of MATLAB/Simulink which is software for modeling, simulating, and analyzing.
G06.2	self driving	2931522054	G06.2_2931522054_4	MATLAB/Simulink provides an interface between ROS and MATLAB/Simulink that enables to create functionalities of ROS-based robots in MATLAB/Simulink.
G06.2	self driving	2931522054	G06.2_2931522054_5	However, it is not been fully utilized in the development of self-driving systems yet because there are not enough samples for self-driving, and it is difficult for developers to adopt co-development.
G06.2	self driving	2931522054	G06.2_2931522054_6	Therefore, we provide a MATLAB/Simulink benchmark suite for a ROS-based self-driving system called Autoware.
G06.2	self driving	2931522054	G06.2_2931522054_7	Autoware is popular open-source software that provides a complete set of self-driving modules.
G06.2	self driving	2931522054	G06.2_2931522054_8	The provided benchmark contains MATLAB/Simulink samples available in Autoware.
G06.2	self driving	2931522054	G06.2_2931522054_9	They help to design ROS-based self-driving systems using MATLAB/Simulink.
G06.2	self driving	2954032282	G06.2_2954032282_1	Ensuring the safety of self-driving cars is important, but neither industry nor authorities have settled on a standard way to test them.
G06.2	self driving	2954032282	G06.2_2954032282_2	Deploying self-driving cars for testing in regular traffic is a common, but costly and risky method, which has already caused fatalities.
G06.2	self driving	2954032282	G06.2_2954032282_3	As a safer alternative, virtual tests, in which self-driving car software is tested in computer simulations, have been proposed.
G06.2	self driving	2954032282	G06.2_2954032282_4	One cannot hope to sufficiently cover the huge number of possible driving situations self-driving cars must be tested for by manually creating such tests.
G06.2	self driving	2954032282	G06.2_2954032282_5	Therefore, we developed AsFault, a tool for automatically generating virtual tests for systematically testing self-driving car software.
G06.2	self driving	2954032282	G06.2_2954032282_6	We demonstrate AsFault by testing the lane keeping feature of an artificial intelligence-based self-driving car software, for which AsFault generates scenarios that cause it to drive off the road.
G06.2	self driving	2954032282	G06.2_2954032282_7	A video illustrating AsFault in action is available at: https://youtu.be/lJ1sa42VLDw
G06.2	self driving	2982382045	G06.2_2982382045_1	At the brink of the introduction of self-driving vehicles, only little is known about how potential users perceive them.
G06.2	self driving	2982382045	G06.2_2982382045_2	This is especially true for self-driving vehicles deployed in public transport services.
G06.2	self driving	2982382045	G06.2_2982382045_3	In this study, the relative preferences for a trip with a self-driving bus is assessed compared to a trip with a regular bus, based on a stated preference experiment.
G06.2	self driving	2982382045	G06.2_2982382045_4	Based on the responses of 282 respondents from the Netherlands and Germany, a discrete choice model is estimated as a Mixed Logit model including attitudes towards trust in self-driving vehicles and interest in technology.
G06.2	self driving	2982382045	G06.2_2982382045_5	The results show that currently public transport passengers prefer the self-driving bus over the regular bus only for short trips.
G06.2	self driving	2982382045	G06.2_2982382045_6	This is due to the finding that the value of travel time is about twice as high for the self-driving bus as for the regular bus for a short commuting trip.
G06.2	self driving	2982382045	G06.2_2982382045_7	Findings from this study further suggest that the popularity of self-driving busses decreases with the presence of a human steward on-board, or if they are operated as a demand-responsive service with fixed routes.
G06.2	self driving	2982382045	G06.2_2982382045_8	People who currently show a strong interest in technology or trust in automated vehicle technology perceive the self-driving busses better than others.
G06.2	self driving	2982382045	G06.2_2982382045_9	Preferences towards automated public transport services are expected to evolve along with the transition from demonstration pilots to their deployment in regular operations.
G06.2	self driving	2935172463	G06.2_2935172463_1	The management of self-driving systems is becoming more complex as the development of self-driving technology progresses.
G06.2	self driving	2935172463	G06.2_2935172463_2	One approach to the development of self-driving systems is the use of ROS; however, the system used in the automotive industry is typically designed using MATLAB/Simulink, which can simulate and evaluate the models used for self-driving.
G06.2	self driving	2935172463	G06.2_2935172463_3	These models are incompatible with ROS-based systems.
G06.2	self driving	2935172463	G06.2_2935172463_4	To allow the two to be used in tandem, it is necessary to rewrite the C++ code and incorporate them into the ROS-based system, which makes development inefficient.
G06.2	self driving	2935172463	G06.2_2935172463_5	Therefore, the proposed framework allows models created using MATLAB/Simulink to be used in a ROS-based self-driving system, thereby improving development efficiency.
G06.2	self driving	2935172463	G06.2_2935172463_6	Furthermore, our evaluations of the proposed framework demonstrated its practical potential.
G07.1	misinformation	2239526842	G07.1_2239526842_1	Online Social Networks OSNs have become increasingly popular means of information sharing among users.
G07.1	misinformation	2239526842	G07.1_2239526842_2	The spread of news regarding emergency events is common in OSNs and so is the spread of misinformation related to the event.
G07.1	misinformation	2239526842	G07.1_2239526842_3	We define as misinformation any false or inaccurate information that is spread either intentionally or unintentionally.
G07.1	misinformation	2239526842	G07.1_2239526842_4	In this paper we study the problem of misinformation identification in OSNs, and we focus in particular on the Twitter social network.
G07.1	misinformation	2239526842	G07.1_2239526842_5	Based on user and tweets characteristics, we build a misinformation detection model that identifies suspicious behavioral patterns and exploits supervised learning techniques to detect misinformation.
G07.1	misinformation	2239526842	G07.1_2239526842_6	Our extensive experimental results on 80294 unique tweets and 59660 users illustrate that our approach effectively identifies misinformation during emergencies.
G07.1	misinformation	2239526842	G07.1_2239526842_7	Furthermore, our model manages to timely identify misinformation, a feature that can be used to limit the spread of the misinformation.
G07.1	misinformation	2894304194	G07.1_2894304194_1	Superintelligence is a potential type of future artificial intelligence (AI) that is significantly more intelligent than humans in all major respects.
G07.1	misinformation	2894304194	G07.1_2894304194_2	If built, superintelligence could be a transformative event, with potential consequences that are massively beneficial or catastrophic.
G07.1	misinformation	2894304194	G07.1_2894304194_3	Meanwhile, the prospect of superintelligence is the subject of major ongoing debate, which includes a significant amount of misinformation.
G07.1	misinformation	2894304194	G07.1_2894304194_4	Superintelligence misinformation is potentially dangerous, ultimately leading bad decisions by the would-be developers of superintelligence and those who influence them.
G07.1	misinformation	2894304194	G07.1_2894304194_5	This paper surveys strategies to counter superintelligence misinformation.
G07.1	misinformation	2894304194	G07.1_2894304194_6	Two types of strategies are examined: strategies to prevent the spread of superintelligence misinformation and strategies to correct it after it has spread.
G07.1	misinformation	2894304194	G07.1_2894304194_7	In general, misinformation can be difficult to correct, suggesting a high value of strategies to prevent it.
G07.1	misinformation	2894304194	G07.1_2894304194_8	The strategies proposed can be applied to lay public attention to superintelligence, AI education programs, and efforts to build expert consensus.
G07.1	misinformation	2950010073	G07.1_2950010073_1	The widespread online misinformation could cause public panic and serious economic damages.
G07.1	misinformation	2950010073	G07.1_2950010073_2	The misinformation containment problem aims at limiting the spread of misinformation in online social networks by launching competing campaigns.
G07.1	misinformation	2950010073	G07.1_2950010073_3	Motivated by realistic scenarios, we present the first analysis of the misinformation containment problem for the case when an arbitrary number of cascades are allowed.
G07.1	misinformation	2950010073	G07.1_2950010073_4	First, we provide a formal model for multi-cascade diffusion and introduce an important concept called as cascade priority.
G07.1	misinformation	2950010073	G07.1_2950010073_5	Second, we show that the misinformation containment problem cannot be approximated within a factor of $\\Omega(2^{\\log^{1-\\epsilon}n^4})$ in polynomial time unless $NP \\subseteq DTIME(n^{\\polylog{n}})$.
G07.1	misinformation	2950010073	G07.1_2950010073_6	Third, we introduce several types of cascade priority that are frequently seen in real social networks.
G07.1	misinformation	2950010073	G07.1_2950010073_7	Finally, we design novel algorithms for solving the misinformation containment problem.
G07.1	misinformation	2950010073	G07.1_2950010073_8	The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is supported by encouraging experimental results.
G07.1	misinformation	2100028027	G07.1_2100028027_1	Inaccurate information, in the field of library and information science, is often regarded as a problem that needs to be corrected or simply understood as either misinformation or disinformation without further consideration.
G07.1	misinformation	2100028027	G07.1_2100028027_2	Misinformation and disinformation, however, may cause significant problems for users in online environments, where they are constantly exposed to an abundance of inaccurate and/or misleading information.
G07.1	misinformation	2100028027	G07.1_2100028027_3	This paper aims to establish conceptual groundwork for future empirical research by examining the relationships among information, misinformation, and disinformation.
G07.1	misinformation	2100028027	G07.1_2100028027_4	Our analysis extends to a discussion of cues to deception, as means for detecting misinformation and disinformation.
G07.1	misinformation	2100028027	G07.1_2100028027_5	We argue that misinformation and disinformation are related yet distinct sub-categories of information.
G07.1	misinformation	2100028027	G07.1_2100028027_6	Misinformation is a multifaceted concept, more complex than simply being inaccurate or incomplete, and disinformation does not always entail misinformation.
G07.1	misinformation	2111507945	G07.1_2111507945_1	The growth of social media provides a convenient communication scheme for people, but at the same time it becomes a hotbed of misinformation.
G07.1	misinformation	2111507945	G07.1_2111507945_2	The wide spread of misinformation over social media is injurious to public interest.
G07.1	misinformation	2111507945	G07.1_2111507945_3	We design a framework, which integrates collective intelligence and machine intelligence, to help identify misinformation.
G07.1	misinformation	2111507945	G07.1_2111507945_4	The basic idea is: (1) automatically index the expertise of users according to their microblog contents; and (2) match the experts with given suspected misinformation.
G07.1	misinformation	2111507945	G07.1_2111507945_5	By sending the suspected misinformation to appropriate experts, we can collect the assessments of experts to judge the credibility of information, and help refute misinformation.
G07.1	misinformation	2111507945	G07.1_2111507945_6	In this paper, we focus on expert finding for misinformation identification.
G07.1	misinformation	2111507945	G07.1_2111507945_7	We propose a tag-based method to index the expertise of microblog users with social tags.
G07.1	misinformation	2111507945	G07.1_2111507945_8	Experiments on a real world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for expert finding with respect to misinformation identification in microblogs.
G07.1	misinformation	2124690797	G07.1_2124690797_1	The importance of research on misinformation has received wide recognition.
G07.1	misinformation	2124690797	G07.1_2124690797_2	Two major challenges faced by this research community are the lack of theoretical models and the scarcity of misinformation in support of such research.
G07.1	misinformation	2124690797	G07.1_2124690797_3	This paper aims to address the aforementioned challenges by conceptualizing misinformation and enabling the interoperability of misinformation.
G07.1	misinformation	2124690797	G07.1_2124690797_4	In particular, a representation and a model of misinformation are proposed through surveying, synthesizing, and explicating existing work in the field.
G07.1	misinformation	2124690797	G07.1_2124690797_5	The ontology-supported misinformation model can not only guide future misinformation research but also lay the foundation for building a digital misinformation library by advancing our knowledge on misinformation and by improving its sharing, management, and reuse.
G07.1	misinformation	2124690797	G07.1_2124690797_6	In addition, we present a formal methodology for managing misinformation in a digital library, and suggest future research directions related to the misinformation model.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2773680786	G07.2_2773680786_1	Conspiracy theories have gained much academic and media attention recently, due to their large impact on public events.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2773680786	G07.2_2773680786_2	However, little is known about how conspiracy theories are produced and developed on social media.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2773680786	G07.2_2773680786_3	We present a qualitative study of conspiracy theorizing on Reddit during a public health crisis--the Zika virus outbreak.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2773680786	G07.2_2773680786_4	Using a mixed-methods approach including content analysis and discourse analysis, we identified types of conspiracy theories that appeared on Reddit in response to the Zika crisis, the conditions under which Zika conspiracy theories emerge, and the particular discursive strategies through which Zika conspiracy theories developed in online forums.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2773680786	G07.2_2773680786_5	Our analysis shows that conspiracy talk emerged as people attempted to make sense of a public health crisis, reflecting their emergent information needs and their pervasive distrust in formal sources of Zika information.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2773680786	G07.2_2773680786_6	Practical implications for social computing researchers, health practitioners, and policymakers are discussed.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2899514909	G07.2_2899514909_1	Conspiracy theories are omnipresent in online discussions---whether to explain a late-breaking event that still lacks official report or to give voice to political dissent.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2899514909	G07.2_2899514909_2	Conspiracy theories evolve, multiply, and interconnect, further complicating efforts to understand them and to limit their propagation.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2899514909	G07.2_2899514909_3	It is therefore crucial to develop scalable methods to examine the nature of conspiratorial discussions in online communities.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2899514909	G07.2_2899514909_4	What do users talk about when they discuss conspiracy theories online? What are the recurring elements in their discussions? What do these elements tell us about the way users think? This work answers these questions by analyzing over ten years of discussions in r/conspiracy---an online community on Reddit dedicated to conspiratorial discussions.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2899514909	G07.2_2899514909_5	We focus on the key elements of a conspiracy theory: the conspiratorial agents, the actions they perform, and their targets.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2899514909	G07.2_2899514909_6	"For example, a narrative-motif such as \""governmental agency-controls-communications\"" represents the various ways in which multiple conspiratorial statements denote how governmental agencies control information."
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2899514909	G07.2_2899514909_7	Thus, narrative-motifs expose commonalities between multiple conspiracy theories even when they refer to different events or circumstances.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2899514909	G07.2_2899514909_8	In the process, these representations help us understand how users talk about conspiracy theories and offer us a means to interpret what they talk about.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2899514909	G07.2_2899514909_9	Our approach enables a population-scale study of conspiracy theories in alternative news and social media with implications for understanding their adoption and combating their spread.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2749521565	G07.2_2749521565_1	Yet contemporary work in Philosophy argues provisional belief in conspiracy theories is—at the very—least understandable (because conspiracies occur) and if we take an evidential approach—judging individual conspiracy theories on their particular merits—belief in such theories turns out to be warranted in a range of cases.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2749521565	G07.2_2749521565_2	Drawing on this work, I examine the kinds of evidence typically associated with conspiracy theories, showing that the evidential problems typically associated with conspiracy theories are not unique to such theories.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2749521565	G07.2_2749521565_3	As such, if there is a problem with the conspiracy theorist’s use of evidence, it is one of principle: is the principle which guides their use of evidence somehow in error? I argue that whatever we might think about conspiracy theories generally, there is no prima facie case for a scepticism of conspiracy theories based purely on their use of evidence.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2907181942	G08.1_2907181942_1	Cryptocurrency is a rapid developing financial technology innovation which has attracted a large number of people around the world.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2907181942	G08.1_2907181942_2	The high-speed evolution, radical price fluctuations of cryptocurrency, and the inconsistent attitudes of monetary authorities in different countries have triggered panic and chain reactions towards the application and adoption of cryptocurrency and have caused public security related events.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2907181942	G08.1_2907181942_3	In this paper, we analyze the dynamics and systemic risk of the cryptocurrency market based on the public available price history.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2907181942	G08.1_2907181942_4	Furthermore, consistent with public perception, our quantitative analysis reveals that the cryptocurrency market is relatively fragile and unstable.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2806518684	G08.1_2806518684_1	Blockchain technology is the underlying enabling technology developed for Bitcoin, the most common cryptocurrency.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2806518684	G08.1_2806518684_2	Blockchain technologies have become increasingly popular with the potential to become a powerful disruptive force.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2806518684	G08.1_2806518684_3	Individuals and organizations may benefit from blockchain with its ability to increase secure data exchange and to make that transaction simpler and easier between entities.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2806518684	G08.1_2806518684_4	We investigate factors that influence an individualu0027s intention to use a blockchain cryptocurrency.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2806518684	G08.1_2806518684_5	We develop a model of cryptocurrency adoption grounded in the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to: identify the determinants for the acceptance of cryptocurrency and explore the relative importance of each construct.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2806518684	G08.1_2806518684_6	We offer empirical evidence for a better theoretical understanding of cryptocurrency adoption with practical implications in an e-government context.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2972302621	G08.1_2972302621_1	Cryptocurrency was built initially as a possible implementation of digital currency, then various derivatives were created in a variety of fields such as financial transactions, capital management, and even nonmonetary applications.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2972302621	G08.1_2972302621_2	This paper aims to offer analytical insights to help understand cryptocurrency by treating it as a financial asset.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2972302621	G08.1_2972302621_3	We position cryptocurrency by comparing its dynamic characteristics with two traditional and massively adopted financial assets: foreign exchange and stock.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2972302621	G08.1_2972302621_4	Our investigation suggests that the dynamics of cryptocurrency are more similar to stock.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	2972302621	G08.1_2972302621_5	As to the robustness and clustering structure, our analysis shows cryptocurrency market is more fragile than stock market, thus it is currently a high-risk financial market.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	3004077497	G08.1_3004077497_1	The smart device owning rate such as smart phone and smart watch is higher than ever before and mobile payment has become one of the major payment methods in many different areas.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	3004077497	G08.1_3004077497_2	At the same time, blockchain-based cryptocurrency is becoming a nonnegligible type of currency and the total value of all types of cryptocurrency has reached USD 200 billion.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	3004077497	G08.1_3004077497_3	Therefore, it is a natural demand to support cryptocurrency payment on mobile devices.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	3004077497	G08.1_3004077497_4	Considering the poor infrastructure and low penetration of financial service in developing countries, this combination is especially attractive.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	3004077497	G08.1_3004077497_5	The high storage cost and payment processing latency are the two main obstacles for mobile payment using cryptocurrency.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	3004077497	G08.1_3004077497_6	We propose two different schemes for cryptocurrency mobile payment, one involves a centralized bank and the other one does not require any centralized party.
G08.1	cryptocurrency	3004077497	G08.1_3004077497_7	We also provide a solution for the bank to meet KYC (know your customer)/AML (antimoney laundering) compliance requirements when it is involved in cryptocurrency mobile payment processing.
G08.2	financial markets	1607424157	G08.2_1607424157_1	Motivated by recent financial crises significant research efforts have been put into studying contagion effects and herding behaviour in financial markets.
G08.2	financial markets	1607424157	G08.2_1607424157_2	Much less has been said about influence of financial news on financial markets.
G08.2	financial markets	1607424157	G08.2_1607424157_3	We propose a novel measure of collective behaviour in financial news on the Web, News Cohesiveness Index (NCI), and show that it can be used as a systemic risk indicator.
G08.2	financial markets	1607424157	G08.2_1607424157_4	We evaluate the NCI on financial documents from large Web news sources on a daily basis from October 2011 to July 2013 and analyse the interplay between financial markets and financially related news.
G08.2	financial markets	1607424157	G08.2_1607424157_5	We hypothesized that strong cohesion in financial news reflects movements in the financial markets.
G08.2	financial markets	1607424157	G08.2_1607424157_6	Cohesiveness is more general and robust measure of systemic risk expressed in news, than measures based on simple occurrences of specific terms.
G08.2	financial markets	1607424157	G08.2_1607424157_7	Our results indicate that cohesiveness in the financial news is highly correlated with and driven by volatility on the financial markets.
G08.2	financial markets	2807531787	G08.2_2807531787_1	In this paper, I propose a methodology to study the comovement between the entropy of different financial markets.
G08.2	financial markets	2807531787	G08.2_2807531787_2	The entropy is derived using singular value decomposition of the components of stock market indices in financial markets from selected developed economies, i.e., France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
G08.2	financial markets	2807531787	G08.2_2807531787_3	I study how a shock in the entropy in the United States affects the entropy in the other financial markets.
G08.2	financial markets	2807531787	G08.2_2807531787_4	I also model the entropy using a dynamic factor model and derive a common factor behind the entropy movements in these four markets.
G09.1	forensics	2202800066	G09.1_2202800066_1	Mobile devices are very common in everyone’s day-to- day life.
G09.1	forensics	2202800066	G09.1_2202800066_2	Nowadays such devices come with many features of desktop or laptop.
G09.1	forensics	2202800066	G09.1_2202800066_3	Hence people can use these devices for diverse applications.
G09.1	forensics	2202800066	G09.1_2202800066_4	As the acceptability and usability of such devices are very high, there are chances that these devices can be used for illegal activities.
G09.1	forensics	2202800066	G09.1_2202800066_5	The percentage of mobile phones or smart phones involved in cyber crimes is in hike.
G09.1	forensics	2202800066	G09.1_2202800066_6	So it becomes necessary to digitally analyze such devices requiring cyber forensics tools.
G09.1	forensics	2202800066	G09.1_2202800066_7	This paper discusses different types of digital evidence present in Microsoft’s Windows Mobile smart phones and an agent based approach for logically acquiring such devices.
G09.1	forensics	2202800066	G09.1_2202800066_8	Also it describes a tool developed for forensically acquiring and analyzing Windows Mobile devices and WinCE PDAs.
G09.1	forensics	2921035272	G09.1_2921035272_1	The increasing prevalence of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has made it inevitable that their pertinence to digital forensic investigations will increase into the foreseeable future.
G09.1	forensics	2921035272	G09.1_2921035272_2	These devices produced by various vendors often posses limited standard interfaces for communication, such as USB ports or WiFi/Bluetooth wireless interfaces.
G09.1	forensics	2921035272	G09.1_2921035272_3	Meanwhile, with an increasing mainstream focus on the security and privacy of user data, built-in encryption is becoming commonplace in consumer-level computing devices, and IoT devices are no exception.
G09.1	forensics	2921035272	G09.1_2921035272_4	Under these circumstances, a significant challenge is presented to digital forensic investigations where data from IoT devices needs to be analysed.
G09.1	forensics	2921035272	G09.1_2921035272_5	This work explores the electromagnetic (EM) side-channel analysis literature for the purpose of assisting digital forensic investigations on IoT devices.
G09.1	forensics	2921035272	G09.1_2921035272_6	EM side-channel analysis is a technique where unintentional electromagnetic emissions are used for eavesdropping on the operations and data handling of computing devices.
G09.1	forensics	2921035272	G09.1_2921035272_7	The non-intrusive nature of EM side-channel approaches makes it a viable option to assist digital forensic investigations as these attacks require, and must result in, no modification to the target device.
G09.1	forensics	2921035272	G09.1_2921035272_8	The literature on various EM side-channel analysis attack techniques are discussed – selected on the basis of their applicability in IoT device investigation scenarios.
G09.1	forensics	2921035272	G09.1_2921035272_9	The insight gained from the background study is used to identify promising future applications of the technique for digital forensic analysis on IoT devices – potentially progressing a wide variety of currently hindered digital investigations.
G09.1	forensics	1965213295	G09.1_1965213295_1	The use of mobile phone forensics to investigate fraudulent activity is nothing new.
G09.1	forensics	1965213295	G09.1_1965213295_2	But mobile phones have evolved into smartphones, and fraudsters have evolved with them.
G09.1	forensics	1965213295	G09.1_1965213295_3	Smartphones are packed with functionality that can easily be used for data theft or inappropriate contact with other parties - none of which passes through company-owned systems, and is to all intents and purposes 'off the grid'.
G09.1	forensics	1965213295	G09.1_1965213295_4	Employers need to be aware of these risks when devices are issued, along with ensuring that processes are in place when suspicions are raised, explains Philip Ridley of CCL-Forensics.
G09.1	forensics	1965213295	G09.1_1965213295_5	Detecting 'tech-savvy' corporate fraudsters is a constant game of catch-up.
G09.1	forensics	1965213295	G09.1_1965213295_6	It's not only about playing catch-up with the intellect, motives and awareness of the e-fraudster, but also the technologies that can be misused.
G09.1	forensics	1965213295	G09.1_1965213295_7	What's more, the methods through which the technology can be manipulated to secrete, disguise and protect fraudulent activities - all while staying away from corporate networks where they can readily be monitored and detected - are constantly evolving.
G09.1	forensics	1965213295	G09.1_1965213295_8	This means a company's intellectual property and sensitive data is at risk of sabotage or just good old-fashioned theft.

G07.2	conspiracy theories	170316166	G07.2_170316166_7	Moreover, we measure the effect of 4709 evidently false information (satirical version of conspiracist stories) and 4502 debunking memes (information aiming at contrasting unsubstantiated rumors) on polarized users of conspiracy claims.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	1887815499	G07.2_1887815499_1	We propose a novel approach framed in terms of information theory and entropy to tackle the issue of the propagation of conspiracy theories.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	1887815499	G07.2_1887815499_2	We represent the initial report of an event (such as the 9/11 terroristic attack) as a series of strings of information, each string classified by a two-state variable Ei = ±1, i = 1, …, N. If the values of the Ei are set to −1 for all strings, a state of minimum entropy is achieved.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	1887815499	G07.2_1887815499_3	Comments on the report, focusing repeatedly on several strings Ek, might alternate their meaning (from −1 to +1).
G07.2	conspiracy theories	1887815499	G07.2_1887815499_4	The representation of the event is turned fuzzy with an increased entropy value.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	1887815499	G07.2_1887815499_5	Beyond some threshold value of entropy, chosen by simplicity to its maximum value, meaning N/2 variables with Ei = 1, the chance is created that a conspiracy theory might be initiated/propagated.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	1887815499	G07.2_1887815499_6	Therefore, the evolution of the associated entropy is a way to measure the degree of penetration of a conspiracy theory.

T16.2	guessing attack	2010327684	T16.2_2010327684_3	However, Ku, Chen, and Lee pointed out that their scheme can not resist an off-line guessing attack, a denial-of-service attack, and a stolen-verifier attack.

T16.2	guessing attack	2063867724	T16.2_2063867724_2	This study shows that the password-based multi-server authentication scheme proposed by Yeh and Lo is vulnerable to undetectable password-guessing attack and offline password-guessing attack.
T16.2	guessing attack	2063867724	T16.2_2063867724_3	This study proposes a new password-based multi-server authentication scheme to overcome these vulnerabilities.
T16.2	guessing attack	2063867724	T16.2_2063867724_4	The proposed protocol introduces a new mechanism for protecting user password.
T16.2	guessing attack	2063867724	T16.2_2063867724_5	The RC sends an alternative key to help the server verify the legitimacy of user instead of the user's password.

T16.2	guessing attack	2784826804	T16.2_2784826804_2	Since the smart card is used for securing transaction, then security issue in the smart card becomes important.

G02.1		2173753523	G02.1_2173753523_7	According to our experimental results, each reconstructed confidential image which does turn out to look like the original confidential image through our human visual system and its PSNR is greater than 34 dB for 256 gray level images.
G02.2		1496406490	G02.2_1496406490_1	Identities and profiles are important to enable e-commerce transactions.
G02.2		1496406490	G02.2_1496406490_2	Recent initiatives, like Microsoft .My Services and Liberty Alliance Project, aim at the provision of identity and profile management solutions along with mechanisms to simplify usersu0027 experience.
G02.2		1496406490	G02.2_1496406490_3	These solutions must be trusted and accountable.
G02.2		1496406490	G02.2_1496406490_4	Current PKI solutions can be used to deal with certification and trust management.
G02.2		1496406490	G02.2_1496406490_5	Unfortunately the complexity of managing digital credential lifecycle is one of the obstacles to their adoption.
G02.2		1496406490	G02.2_1496406490_6	This complexity is accentuated in the case of dynamic environments, where the certified information is subject to frequent changes.
G02.2		1496406490	G02.2_1496406490_7	In this paper we address the problem of providing up-to-date certified information in dynamic contexts.
G02.2		1496406490	G02.2_1496406490_8	We introduce the concept of active digital credential as a mechanism to provide up-to-date certified identity and profile information along with a fine-grained assessment of trustworthiness and validity.
G02.2		1496406490	G02.2_1496406490_9	Work is in progress both to implement a prototype and assess the feasibility of the proposed model.
G02.2		2122915930	G02.2_2122915930_1	By offering personalized content to users, recommender systems have become a vital tool in e-commerce and online media applications.
G02.2		2122915930	G02.2_2122915930_2	Content-based algorithms recommend items or products to users, that are most similar to those previously purchased or consumed.
G02.2		2122915930	G02.2_2122915930_3	Unfortunately, collecting and storing ratings, on which content-based methods rely, also poses a serious privacy risk for the customers: ratings may be very personal or revealing, and thus highly privacy sensitive.
G02.2		2122915930	G02.2_2122915930_4	Service providers could process the collected rating data for other purposes, sell them to third parties or fail to provide adequate physical security.
G02.2		2122915930	G02.2_2122915930_5	In this paper, we propose technological mechanisms to protect the privacy of individuals in a recommender system.
G02.2		2122915930	G02.2_2122915930_6	Our proposal is founded on homomorphic encryption, which is used to obscure the private rating information of the customers from the service provider.
G02.2		2122915930	G02.2_2122915930_7	While the useru0027s privacy is respected by the service provider, by generating recommendations using encrypted customer ratings, the service provideru0027s commercially valuable item-item similarities are protected against curious entities, in turn.
G02.2		2122915930	G02.2_2122915930_8	Our proposal explores simple and efficient cryptographic techniques to generate private recommendations using a server-client model, which neither relies on (trusted) third parties, nor requires interaction with peer users.
G02.2		2122915930	G02.2_2122915930_9	The main strength of our contribution lies in providing a highly efficient solution without resorting to unrealistic assumptions.
G02.2		2406834167	G02.2_2406834167_1	Several recent studies have demonstrated that people show large behavioural uniqueness.
G02.2		2406834167	G02.2_2406834167_2	This has serious privacy implications as most individuals become increasingly re-identifiable in large datasets or can be tracked while they are browsing the web using only a couple of their attributes, called as their fingerprints.
G02.2		2406834167	G02.2_2406834167_3	Often, the success of these attacks depend on explicit constraints on the number of attributes learnable about individuals, i.e., the size of their fingerprints.
G02.2		2406834167	G02.2_2406834167_4	These constraints can be budget as well as technical constraints imposed by the data holder.
G02.2		2406834167	G02.2_2406834167_5	For instance, Apple restricts the number of applications that can be called by another application on iOS in order to mitigate the potential privacy threats of leaking the list of installed applications on a device.
G02.2		2406834167	G02.2_2406834167_6	In this work, we address the problem of identifying the attributes (e.g., smartphone applications) that can serve as a fingerprint of users given constraints on the size of the fingerprint.
G02.2		2406834167	G02.2_2406834167_7	We give the best fingerprinting algorithms in general, and evaluate their effectiveness on several real-world datasets.
G02.2		2406834167	G02.2_2406834167_8	Our results show that current privacy guards limiting the number of attributes that can be queried about individuals is insufficient to mitigate their potential privacy risks in many practical cases.
G04.1		2102726567	G04.1_2102726567_1	Virtual screening of a large chemical library for drug lead identification requires searching/superimposing a large number of three-dimensional (3D) chemical structures.
G04.1		2102726567	G04.1_2102726567_2	This article reports a graphic processing unit (GPU)-accelerated weighted Gaussian algorithm (gWEGA) that expedites shape or shape-feature similarity score-based virtual screening.
G04.1		2102726567	G04.1_2102726567_3	With 86 GPU nodes (each node has one GPU card), gWEGA can screen 110 million conformations derived from an entire ZINC drug-like database with diverse antidiabetic agents as query structures within 2 s (i.e., screening more than 55 million conformations per second).
G04.1		2102726567	G04.1_2102726567_4	The rapid screening speed was accomplished through the massive parallelization on multiple GPU nodes and rapid prescreening of 3D structures (based on their shape descriptors and pharmacophore feature compositions).

G04.1		2268932570	G04.1_2268932570_1	Summary: Identifying chemical probes or seeking scaffolds for a specific biological target is important for protein function studies.
G04.1		2268932570	G04.1_2268932570_2	Therefore, we create the Annotated Scaffold Database (ASDB), a computer-readable and systematic target-annotated scaffold database, to serve such needs.
G04.1		2268932570	G04.1_2268932570_3	The scaffolds in ASDB were derived from public databases including ChEMBL, DrugBank and TCMSP, with a scaffold-based classification approach.
G04.1		2268932570	G04.1_2268932570_4	Each scaffold was assigned with an InChIKey as its unique identifier, energy-minimized 3D conformations, and other calculated properties.
G04.1		2268932570	G04.1_2268932570_5	A scaffold is also associated with drugs, natural products, drug targets and medical indications.
G04.1		2268932570	G04.1_2268932570_6	The database can be retrieved through text or structure query tools.
G04.1		2268932570	G04.1_2268932570_7	ASDB collects 333 601 scaffolds, which are associated with 4368 targets.
G04.1		2268932570	G04.1_2268932570_8	The scaffolds consist of 3032 scaffolds derived from drugs and 5163 scaffolds derived from natural products.
G04.1		2268932570	G04.1_2268932570_9	For given scaffolds, scaffold-target networks can be generated from the database to demonstrate the relations of scaffolds and targets.
G04.1		2268932570	G04.1_2268932570_10	Availability and implementation: ASDB is freely available at http://www.rcdd.org.cn/asdb/with the major web browsers.

G04.1		2137690465	G04.1_2137690465_1	Druggable Protein–protein Interaction Assessment System (Dr. PIAS) is a database of druggable protein–protein interactions (PPIs) predicted by our support vector machine (SVM)-based method.
G04.1		2137690465	G04.1_2137690465_2	Since the first publication of this database, Dr. PIAS has been updated to version 2.0.
G04.1		2137690465	G04.1_2137690465_3	PPI data have been increased considerably, from 71 500 to 83 324 entries.
G04.1		2137690465	G04.1_2137690465_4	As the new positive instances in our method, 4 PPIs and 10 tertiary structures have been added.
G04.1		2137690465	G04.1_2137690465_5	This addition increases the prediction accuracy of our SVM classifier in comparison with the previous classifier, despite the number of added PPIs and structures is small.
G04.1		2137690465	G04.1_2137690465_6	We have introduced the novel concept of ‘similar positives’ of druggable PPIs, which will help researchers discover small compounds that can inhibit predicted druggable PPIs.
G04.1		2137690465	G04.1_2137690465_7	Dr. PIAS will aid the effective search for druggable PPIs from a mine of interactome data being rapidly accumulated.

G04.2		1981844148	G04.2_1981844148_1	One of the main challenges in protein-protein docking is a meaningful evaluation of the many putative solutions.
G04.2		1981844148	G04.2_1981844148_2	Here we present a program (PROCOS) that calculates a probability-like measure to be native for a given complex.
G04.2		1981844148	G04.2_1981844148_3	In contrast to scores often used for analyzing complex structures, the calculated probabilities offer the advantage of providing a fixed range of expected values.
G04.2		1981844148	G04.2_1981844148_4	This will allow, in principle, the comparison of models corresponding to different targets that were solved with the same algorithm.
G04.2		1981844148	G04.2_1981844148_5	Judgments are based on distributions of properties derived from a large database of native and false complexes.
G04.2		1981844148	G04.2_1981844148_6	For complex analysis PROCOS uses these property distributions of native and false complexes together with a support vector machine (SVM).
G04.2		1981844148	G04.2_1981844148_7	PROCOS was compared to the established scoring schemes of ZRANK and DFIRE.
G04.2		1981844148	G04.2_1981844148_8	Employing a set of experimentally solved native complexes, high probability values above 50% were obtained for 90% of these structures.
G04.2		1981844148	G04.2_1981844148_9	Next, the performance of PROCOS was tested on the 40 binary targets of the Dockground decoy set, on 14 targets of the RosettaDock decoy set and on 9 targets that participated in the CAPRI scoring evaluation.
G04.2		1981844148	G04.2_1981844148_10	Again the advantage of using a probability-based scoring system becomes apparent and a reasonable number of near native complexes was found within the top ranked complexes.
G04.2		1981844148	G04.2_1981844148_11	In conclusion, a novel fully automated method is presented that allows the reliable evaluation of protein-protein complexes.
G04.2		2072768184	G04.2_2072768184_1	The Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP) has produced a large number of gene expression patterns, many of which have been annotated textually with anatomical and developmental terms.
G04.2		2072768184	G04.2_2072768184_2	These terms spatially correspond to local regions of the images; however, they are attached collectively to groups of images, such that it is unknown which term is assigned to which region of which image in the group.
G04.2		2072768184	G04.2_2072768184_3	This poses a challenge to the development of the computational method to automate the textual description of expression patterns contained in each image.
G04.2		2072768184	G04.2_2072768184_4	In this paper, we show that the underlying nature of this task matches well with a new machine learning framework, Multi-Instance Multi-Label learning (MIML).
G04.2		2072768184	G04.2_2072768184_5	We propose a new MIML support vector machine to solve the problems that beset the annotation task.
G04.2		2072768184	G04.2_2072768184_6	Empirical study shows that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art Drosophila gene expression pattern annotation methods.
G04.3		1519137304	G04.3_1519137304_1	With the growing threat of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, which spread more easily and quickly worldwide resulted from the globalization, it is necessary to be capable to forecast significant changes of infectious diseases for emergency preparation purpose.
G04.3		1519137304	G04.3_1519137304_2	Foresight China Project aims at exploring a new method by identifying the drivers of infectious diseases and predicting the trends of these drivers.
G04.3		1523076482	G04.3_1523076482_1	The next-generation model outlined in the AMIA Roadmap for National Action on Clinical Decision Support (CDS) is aimed to optimize the effectiveness of CDS interventions, and to achieve widespread adoption.
G04.3		1523076482	G04.3_1523076482_2	BJC HealthCare re-engineered its existing CDS system in alignment with the AMIA roadmap and plans to use it for guidance on further enhancements.
G04.3		1523076482	G04.3_1523076482_3	We present our experience and discuss an incremental approach to migrate towards the next generation of CDS applications from the viewpoint of a healthcare institution.
G04.3		1523076482	G04.3_1523076482_4	Specifically, a CDS rule engine service with a standards-based rule representation format was built to simplify maintenance and deployment.
G04.3		1523076482	G04.3_1523076482_5	Rules were separated from execution code and made customizable for multi-facility deployment.
G04.3		1523076482	G04.3_1523076482_6	Those changes resulted in system improvements in the short term while aligning with long-term strategic objectives.
G06.2		2886776222	G06.2_2886776222_1	The paper describes an investigation into the public opinion about self-driving vehicles among Dutch people.
G06.2		2886776222	G06.2_2886776222_2	New in our approach is to design a questionnaire on the basis of different theories of acceptance of new technology in organisations and society in combinations with additional questions about specific factors such as the economic implications of self-driving vehicle services.
G06.2		2886776222	G06.2_2886776222_3	As results, we present a predictive model of public opinion about self-driving cars that evaluates the relevant factors and which shows the feasibility of a theory-based approach to design survey tools.
G07.1		2012336753	G07.1_2012336753_1	The World Wide Web is a potentially powerful channel for misinformation.
G07.1		2012336753	G07.1_2012336753_2	Focusing upon scholarly misconduct as a source of misinformation, examines the potential impact of misinformation on the Web.
G07.1		2012336753	G07.1_2012336753_3	Floridi has suggested three methods of countering misinformation on the Web: quality certification of information sources; limiting monopolies controlling information resources on the Web; and greater information literacy among Web users.
G07.1		2012336753	G07.1_2012336753_4	Focus groups composed of LIS faculty and research students in Singapore discussed this topic.
G07.1		2012336753	G07.1_2012336753_5	Members of the groups felt that there was sufficient motivation for trying to publish the results of scholarly misconduct on the Web.
G07.1		2012336753	G07.1_2012336753_6	Group members agreed that greater information literacy was a good way to counter misinformation.
G07.1		2012336753	G07.1_2012336753_7	They did not believe that quality certification would stop misinformation, and that there was a danger that a certifying group would become a censoring body.
G07.1		2012336753	G07.1_2012336753_8	Focus group members said that greater plurality would decrease misinformation.
G07.1		2012336753	G07.1_2012336753_9	Some argued that large and prestigious publishers should be welcomed on to the Web rather than opposed.
G07.1		2025749534	G07.1_2025749534_1	This paper examines the relationship between misinformation about product quality and quality standards, such as minimum quality standards (MQSs) and certification criteria, when products are vertically differentiated in terms of their health/safety aspects.
G07.1		2025749534	G07.1_2025749534_2	We investigate the welfare effect of regulating misinformation and strengthening MQSs.
G07.1		2025749534	G07.1_2025749534_3	We find that the welfare effect of a decrease in misinformation crucially depends on the existing amount of misinformation; moreover, a more stringent MQS either improves or deteriorates welfare.
G07.1		2025749534	G07.1_2025749534_4	Two effects figure strongly throughout our results.
G07.1		2025749534	G07.1_2025749534_5	First, changes in misinformation and/or an MQS make price competition between firms more or less serious, causing changes in price and quantity.
G07.1		2025749534	G07.1_2025749534_6	Second, these changes influence some consumers’ choices, leading them to change the products that they purchase.
G07.1		2025749534	G07.1_2025749534_7	This change in consumption behavior increases or decreases inappropriate choices when misinformation is present.
G07.1		2025749534	G07.1_2025749534_8	We extend the analysis to the case in which a high-quality firm’s quality investment is endogenously determined.
G08.1		2999674664	G08.1_2999674664_1	Cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies have developed in parallel in recent years, with technological breakthroughs in currency issuance, payment methods, and currency storage.
G08.1		2999674664	G08.1_2999674664_2	However, the existing cryptocurrencies cannot replace fiat money.
G08.1		2999674664	G08.1_2999674664_3	There is a huge gap between decentralized cryptocurrency and central bank digital currency, namely CBDC, in terms of monetary governance and circulation.
G08.1		2999674664	G08.1_2999674664_4	In this paper, we propose the function and security requirements of CBDC, through a comprehensive analysis of the existing typical cryptocurrency and the prototype of the CBDC scheme.
G08.1		2999674664	G08.1_2999674664_5	On this basis, we present a blockchain-based framework for CBDC with three layers, including supervisory layer, network layer and user layer, and describe the key business processes of the CBDCu0027s entire lifecycle of issuance-circulation-withdrawal in detail.
G08.1		2999674664	G08.1_2999674664_6	Finally, we take cross-border payment as an example to explain the transaction process of CBDC.
G08.1		2999674664	G08.1_2999674664_7	We aim to provide theoretical guidance for CBDC design.
G08.2		2053103247	G08.2_2053103247_1	Financial markets are primarily driven by three key drivers, technologies, competition and globalization.
G08.2		2053103247	G08.2_2053103247_2	These drivers are accompanied with challenging risks.
G08.2		2053103247	G08.2_2053103247_3	Market authorities monitor activities in order to reduce to the barest minimum the adverse impacts some products and services have on the whole financial system.
G08.2		2053103247	G08.2_2053103247_4	This indicates the need for a high quality monitoring and surveillance system.
G08.2		2053103247	G08.2_2053103247_5	This paper examines financial markets as service systems that jointly create value to stakeholders.
G08.2		2053103247	G08.2_2053103247_6	It proposes a framework for the design of financial market monitoring system based on the concept of service dominant logic, service science and systems thinking.
G08.2		2053103247	G08.2_2053103247_7	Finally, it identifies a number of properties that need to be examined in financial markets service systems.
G09.1		1977415353	G09.1_1977415353_1	In this paper, we present our reverse engineering results for the Zeus crimeware toolkit which is one of the recent and powerful crimeware tools that emerged in the Internet underground community to control botnets.
G09.1		1977415353	G09.1_1977415353_2	Zeus has reportedly infected over 3.6 million computers in the United States.
G09.1		1977415353	G09.1_1977415353_3	Our analysis aims at uncovering the various obfuscation levels and shedding the light on the resulting code.
G09.1		1977415353	G09.1_1977415353_4	Accordingly, we explain the bot building and installation/infection processes.
G09.1		1977415353	G09.1_1977415353_5	In addition, we detail a method to extract the encryption key from the malware binary and use that to decrypt the network communications and the botnet configuration information.
G09.1		1977415353	G09.1_1977415353_6	The reverse engineering insights, together with network traffic analysis, allow for a better understanding of the technologies and behaviors of such modern HTTP botnet crimeware toolkits and opens an opportunity to inject falsified information into the botnet communications which can be used to defame this crimeware toolkit.
G09.1		1971766706	G09.1_1971766706_1	Abstract   Virtualization is a technology that uses a logical environment to overcome physical limitations in hardware.
G09.1		1971766706	G09.1_1971766706_2	Recently, its coverage has become broader.
G09.1		1971766706	G09.1_1971766706_3	Because a virtual machine can perform the same role as an actual system, a recorded user’s activity trail in the virtual machine is important factor in terms of digital forensics.
G09.1		1971766706	G09.1_1971766706_4	If the investigator found trails of the VMware Workstation on the host, he should investigate the virtual machine along with host system.
G09.1		1971766706	G09.1_1971766706_5	However, due to a lack of understanding of the virtual machine, the investigation process is not clear.
G09.1		1971766706	G09.1_1971766706_6	Moreover, a damaged virtual machine image is difficult to investigate because of the structural characteristics.
G09.1		1971766706	G09.1_1971766706_7	Therefore, we need a technical understanding and a research about investigation procedures and recovery methods on the virtual machine.
G09.1		1971766706	G09.1_1971766706_8	In this research, we suggest an investigation procedure of digital forensics and a recovery method on damaged images for the VMware Workstation that has the largest number of users.
G09.1		1940252083	G09.1_1940252083_1	Citadel is an advanced information stealing malware that targets financial information.
G09.1		1940252083	G09.1_1940252083_2	This malware poses a real threat against the confidentiality and integrity of personal and business data.
G09.1		1940252083	G09.1_1940252083_3	Recently, a joint operation has been conducted by FBI and Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit in order to take down Citadel command-and-control servers.
G09.1		1940252083	G09.1_1940252083_4	The operation caused some disruption in the botnet but has not stopped it completely.
G09.1		1940252083	G09.1_1940252083_5	Due to the complex structure and advanced anti-reverse engineering techniques, the Citadel malware analysis process is challenging and time-consuming.
G09.1		1940252083	G09.1_1940252083_6	This allows cyber criminals to carry on with their attacks while the analysis is still in progress.
G09.1		1940252083	G09.1_1940252083_7	In this paper, we present the results of the Citadel reverse engineering and provide additional insights into the functionality, inner workings, and open source components of the malware.
G09.1		1940252083	G09.1_1940252083_8	In order to accelerate the reverse engineering process, we propose a clone-based analysis methodology.
G09.1		1940252083	G09.1_1940252083_9	Citadel is an offspring of a previously analyzed malware called Zeus.
G09.1		1940252083	G09.1_1940252083_10	Thus, using the former as a reference, we can measure and quantify the similarities and differences of the new variant.
G09.1		1940252083	G09.1_1940252083_11	Two types of code analysis techniques are provided in the methodology namely assembly to source code matching, and binary clone detection.
G09.1		1940252083	G09.1_1940252083_12	The methodology can help reduce the number of functions that should be analyzed manually.
G09.1		1940252083	G09.1_1940252083_13	The analysis results prove that the approach is promising in Citadel malware analysis.
G09.1		1940252083	G09.1_1940252083_14	Furthermore, the same approach is applicable to similar malware analysis scenarios.
G09.1		2981809794	G09.1_2981809794_1	In this paper, we reviewed the scientific literature of digital forensics between 1990 to 2019.
G09.1		2981809794	G09.1_2981809794_2	The visualized charts of keyword cloud, surging keywords and co-citation networks were generated by CiteSpace V. Based on the analysis, it was found that: (1) the research contents of digital forensics are focused on eight aspects.
G09.1		2981809794	G09.1_2981809794_3	They are basic theory and methods, physical equipment and forensic methods, image forgery identification, file recovery and data extraction, smart phones and social network forensics, case-based forensics and crime forensics, automatic identification technology and tools, cloud computing and cloud forensics.
G09.1		2981809794	G09.1_2981809794_4	(2) The research evolutional paths were followed by storage media, image forensics technologies, data recovery technologies, encryption and decryption technologies, human and social characteristics.
G09.1		2981809794	G09.1_2981809794_5	(3) The breakthrough of image forgery identification technology accelerated the development of digital forensics; smart phone and social network forensics and automated forensics technologies bring important paradigm shift; in the future, automatic forensics and cloud forensics will be hot research directions.
G09.1		2845881471	G09.1_2845881471_1	As one of the main technologies supporting cloud computing virtualization, Docker is featured in its fast and lightweight virtualization which has been adopted by numerous platform-as-a-service (PaaS) systems, but forensics research for Docker has not been paid the corresponding attention yet.
G09.1		2845881471	G09.1_2845881471_2	Docker exists to store and distribute illegal information as a carrier for initiating attacks like traditional cloud services.
G09.1		2845881471	G09.1_2845881471_3	The paper explains Docker service principles and structural features, and analyzing the model and method of forensics in related cloud environment, then proposes a Docker container forensics solution based on the Docker API.
G09.1		2845881471	G09.1_2845881471_4	In this paper, Docker APIs realize the derivation of the Docker container instances, copying and back-up of the container data volume, extraction of the key evidence data, such as container log information, configuration information and image information, thus conducts localized fixed forensics to volatile evidence and data in the Docker service container.
G09.1		2845881471	G09.1_2845881471_5	Combined with digital signatures and digital encryption technology to achieve the integrity of the original evidence data protection.
G10.1		2909327212	G10.1_2909327212_1	In this paper, we present a visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system for humanoid robots.
G10.1		2909327212	G10.1_2909327212_2	We introduce a new binary descriptor called DLab that exploits the combined information of color, depth, and intensity to achieve robustness with respect to uniqueness, reproducibility, and stability.
G10.1		2909327212	G10.1_2909327212_3	We use DLab within ORB-SLAM, where we replaced the place recognition module with a modification of FAB-MAP that works with newly built codebooks using our binary descriptor.
G10.1		2909327212	G10.1_2909327212_4	In experiments carried out in simulation and with a real Nao humanoid equipped with an RGB-D camera, we show that DLab has a superior performance in comparison to other descriptors.
G10.1		2909327212	G10.1_2909327212_5	The application to feature tracking and place recognition reveal that the new descriptor is able to reliably track features even in sequences with seriously blurred images and that it has a higher percentage of correctly identified similar images.
G10.1		2909327212	G10.1_2909327212_6	As a result, our new visual SLAM system has a lower absolute trajectory error in comparison to ORB-SLAM and is able to accurately track the robotu0027s trajectory.

G15.1	snowden	2294193098	G15.1_2294193098_1	Prior to the NSA affair [1], the threat to electronic enterprise communication was considered to be beyond the firewall.
G15.1	snowden	2294193098	G15.1_2294193098_2	With the Snowden revelations[2] however and the increased use of mobile devices for business email, the need to secure communication from sender to recipient and within the corporate network has raised the awareness[3] for industrial scale end-to-end encryption.
G15.1	snowden	192930805	G15.1_192930805_1	Information provided by whistleblower Edward Snowden imposingly demonstrated the advanced capabilities of intelligence agencies, especially the National Security Agency (NSA), to monitor Internet usage on a large scale.
G15.1	snowden	192930805	G15.1_192930805_2	Huge amounts of data are collected day by day, violating the privacy of millions of people.
G15.1	snowden	192930805	G15.1_192930805_3	Public media suggest that IT security methods like encryption are the magic bullet to protect one’s privacy.
G15.1	snowden	192930805	G15.1_192930805_4	This paper reflects on the feasibility and practical limitations of technical privacy protection.
G15.1	snowden	192930805	G15.1_192930805_5	Current vulnerabilities of widely used IT security mechanisms impressively demonstrate the limitations of these mechanisms.
G15.1	snowden	2786217712	G15.1_2786217712_1	Legislation surrounding digital privacy has seen quite an upheaval in recent years.
G15.1	snowden	2786217712	G15.1_2786217712_2	The introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU, and new resolutions within the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) have recognized the urgency to include recommendations on the use of encryption to protect the digital identities of citizens.
G15.1	snowden	2786217712	G15.1_2786217712_3	In this work, we meander through the main events in history which have shaped the legislative landscape that encompasses the use of encryption, paying particular attention to recent (post-Snowden) developments.
G15.1	snowden	1563336151	G15.1_1563336151_1	The functionality of the Internet and the World Wide Web is determined in large part by the standards that allow for interoperable implementations, as a result, the privacy of our online interactions depends on the work done within standard-setting organizations.

G15.2	cookies	2098473270	G15.2_2098473270_3	In addition, stolen cookies may also incur severe security problems.
G15.2	cookies	2098473270	G15.2_2098473270_4	However, current Web browsers lack secure and convenient mechanisms for cookie management.
G15.2	cookies	2098473270	G15.2_2098473270_5	A cookie management scheme, which is easy-to-use and has minimal privacy risk, is in great demand; but designing such a scheme is a challenge.
G15.2	cookies	2098473270	G15.2_2098473270_6	In this paper, we conduct a large scale HTTP cookie measurement and introduce CookiePicker, a system that can automatically validate the usefulness of cookies from a Web site and set the cookie usage permission on behalf of users.
G15.2	cookies	2098473270	G15.2_2098473270_7	CookiePicker helps users achieve the maximum benefit brought by cookies, while minimizing the possible privacy and security risks.

G15.2	cookies	2105783544	G15.2_2105783544_1	Many large Internet websites are accessed by users anonymously, without requiring registration or logging-in.
G15.2	cookies	2105783544	G15.2_2105783544_2	However, to provide personalized service these sites build anonymous, yet persistent, user models based on repeated user visits.
G15.2	cookies	2105783544	G15.2_2105783544_3	Cookies, issued when a web browser first visits a site, are typically employed to anonymously associate a website visit with a distinct user (web browser).
G15.2	cookies	2105783544	G15.2_2105783544_4	However, users may reset cookies, making such association short-lived and noisy.
G15.2	cookies	2105783544	G15.2_2105783544_5	In this paper we propose a solution to the cookie churn problem: a novel algorithm for grouping similar cookies into clusters that are more persistent than individual cookies.
G15.2	cookies	2105783544	G15.2_2105783544_6	Such clustering could potentially allow more robust estimation of the number of unique visitors of the site over a certain long time period, and also better user modeling which is key to plenty of web applications such as advertising and recommender systems.
G15.2	cookies	2105783544	G15.2_2105783544_7	We present a novel method to cluster browser cookies into groups that are likely to belong to the same browser based on a statistical model of browser visitation patterns.
G15.2	cookies	2105783544	G15.2_2105783544_8	We address each step of the clustering as a binary classification problem estimating the probability that two different subsets of cookies belong to the same browser.
G15.2	cookies	2105783544	G15.2_2105783544_9	We observe that our clustering problem is a generalized interval graph coloring problem, and propose a greedy heuristic algorithm for solving it.
G15.2	cookies	2105783544	G15.2_2105783544_10	The scalability of this method allows us to cluster hundreds of millions of browser cookies and provides significant improvements over baselines such as constrained K-means.

G15.3	gdpr	3006740491	G15.3_3006740491_1	GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is a new regulation of the European Union that superimposes strict privacy constraints on storing, accessing and processing user data, as a way to ensure that personal user data are not violated neither disclosed without an explicit consent.
G15.3	gdpr	3006740491	G15.3_3006740491_2	As a consequence, business processes that interact with large amounts of such data may easily cause GDPR violations, due to the typical complexity of such processes.
G15.3	gdpr	3006740491	G15.3_3006740491_3	Inspired by these considerations, this paper highlights the challenges and critical aspects associated with the GDPR compliance journey when opting for naive straight-forward solutions.
G15.3	gdpr	3006740491	G15.3_3006740491_4	We propose a business-aware GDPR compliance journey using online process mining.
G15.3	gdpr	3006740491	G15.3_3006740491_5	Using several large log files generated based on a real scenario, we show that the proposed tool is both effective and efficient.
G15.3	gdpr	3006740491	G15.3_3006740491_6	As such, it proves to be a powerful concept for usage in incremental GDPR compliance environments.
G15.3	gdpr	2946108943	G15.3_2946108943_1	In an increasingly digital world, where processing and exchange of personal data are key parts of everyday enterprise business processes (BPs), the right to data privacy is regulated and actively enforced in the Europe Union (EU) through the recently introduced General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), whose aim is to protect EU citizens from privacy breaches.
G15.3	gdpr	2946108943	G15.3_2946108943_2	In this direction, GDPR is highly influencing the way organizations must approach data privacy, forcing them to rethink and upgrade their BPs in order to become GDPR compliant.
G15.3	gdpr	2946108943	G15.3_2946108943_3	For many organizations, this can be a daunting task, since little has been done so far to easily identify privacy issues in BPs.
G15.3	gdpr	2946108943	G15.3_2946108943_4	To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we provide an analysis of the main privacy constraints in GDPR and propose a set of design patterns to capturing and integrating such constraints in BP models.
G15.3	gdpr	2946108943	G15.3_2946108943_5	Using BPMN (Business Process Modeling Notation) as modeling notation, our approach allows us to achieve full transparency of privacy constraints in BPs making it possible to ensure their compliance with GDPR.

G16.1	algorithm	2092575453	G16.1_2092575453_3	We provide a solution for the high level of availability of business processes by the use of cluster of enterprise service buses (ESB).
G16.1	algorithm	2092575453	G16.1_2092575453_4	Our approach is based on the dynamic creation of the route between the business services and the migration of a runtime context from one ESB to another one.
G16.1	algorithm	2092575453	G16.1_2092575453_5	So, we insure the management of business processes over a cluster and measure the impact of such incident.

G16.2	nlp applications	2518696416	G16.2_2518696416_1	Semantic similarity measures between linguistic terms are essential in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications.
G16.2	nlp applications	2518696416	G16.2_2518696416_2	Term similarity is most conventionally perceived as a symmetric relation.
G16.2	nlp applications	2518696416	G16.2_2518696416_3	However, semantic directional (asymmetric) relations exist in lexical semantics and make symmetric similarity measures less suitable for their identification.
G16.2	nlp applications	2518696416	G16.2_2518696416_4	Furthermore, directional similarity actually represents even more general conditions and is more practical in some specific NLP applications than symmetric similarity.
G16.2	nlp applications	2518696416	G16.2_2518696416_5	As the footstone of similarity measures, current semantic features cannot efficiently represent large scale web text collections.
G16.2	nlp applications	2518696416	G16.2_2518696416_6	Hence, we propose a new directional similarity method, considering feature representations both in linguistic and extra linguistic dimensions.
G16.2	nlp applications	2518696416	G16.2_2518696416_7	We evaluate our approach on standard word similarity, reporting state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.
G16.2	nlp applications	2518696416	G16.2_2518696416_8	Experiments show that our directional method handles both symmetric and directional semantic relations and leads to clear improvements in entity search and query expansion.

T16.2	guessing attack	2010710834	T16.2_2010710834_5	Chen et al.’s scheme is also vulnerable to an off-line password guessing attack and an undetectable on-line password guessing attack when user’s smart card is stolen.
T16.2	guessing attack	2010710834	T16.2_2010710834_6	In server side, Chen et al.’s scheme needs large computational load to authentication a legal user or reject an illegal user.
T16.2	guessing attack	2010710834	T16.2_2010710834_7	To remedy the weaknesses in Chen et al.’s scheme, we propose an improved smart card based password authentication scheme.
T16.2	guessing attack	2010710834	T16.2_2010710834_8	Our analysis shows that the improved scheme can overcome the weaknesses in Chen et al.’s scheme.
T16.2	guessing attack	2087734433	T16.2_2087734433_1	With the increased use of encryption in business, key recovery has emerged as a critical issue to users.
T16.2	guessing attack	2087734433	T16.2_2087734433_2	As encryption is deployed to protect files and network communications, users must include safeguards that prevent the inadvertent loss of data and use of the network for malicious intent.
T16.2	guessing attack	2087734433	T16.2_2087734433_3	This paper explains what key recovery is, presents a refined practical model of a key recovery scheme and describes a new key recovery scheme compliant with this model.
T16.2	guessing attack	2087734433	T16.2_2087734433_4	A novel feature of this key recovery scheme is that it is resistant to online guessing attack.
T16.2	guessing attack	2087734433	T16.2_2087734433_5	Most of key recovery schemes used today are able to detect online guessing attack but not able to prevent it.
T16.2	guessing attack	2087734433	T16.2_2087734433_6	Consequently, users face the problem of denial of service which occurs when key recovery server shuts down the service to legitimate users though temporarily as a security measure.
T16.2	guessing attack	2087734433	T16.2_2087734433_7	Key recovery server also, often ask users to change password which was attacked causing further inconvenience.
T16.2	guessing attack	2087734433	T16.2_2087734433_8	So, a security solution Captcha is employed in this new key recovery scheme to make it secure against online guessing attack.
T17.4	key generation	2072049844	T17.4_2072049844_1	Although smart cards are becoming used in an increasing number of applications, there is small literature of the implementation issues for smart cards.
T17.4	key generation	2072049844	T17.4_2072049844_2	This paper describes the issues and considerations that need to be taken into account when implementing the key generation step of a cryptographic algorithm widely used nowadays, RSA.Smart cards are used in many applications that require a tamper resistant area.
T17.4	key generation	2072049844	T17.4_2072049844_3	Therefore, smart cards that use cryptography have to provide encryption, decryption, as well as key generation inside its security perimeter.
T17.4	key generation	2072049844	T17.4_2072049844_4	RSA key generation is a concern for on-card implementation of RSA cryptosystem, as it usually takes a long time.
T17.4	key generation	2072049844	T17.4_2072049844_5	In this paper, two simple but efficient key generation algorithms are evaluated, in addition to a simple but not very efficient algorithm.
T17.4	key generation	2072049844	T17.4_2072049844_6	The paper discusses in detail how to build fast implementations for the three algorithms presented, using smart cards with crypto-coprocessor.
T18.1	backscatter	2088429605	T18.1_2088429605_1	Passive, backscatter radio frequency identification (RFID) systems are often range limited by the power incident on the radio frequency (RF) tag.
T18.1	backscatter	2088429605	T18.1_2088429605_2	We have demonstrated an increase in the power incident on the RF tag using transmit diversity in a monostatic backscatter channel.
T18.1	backscatter	2088429605	T18.1_2088429605_3	Transmit diversity was achieved by phase conjugating the forward link of the backscatter channel associated with each reader antenna.
T18.1	backscatter	2088429605	T18.1_2088429605_4	The resulting increase in incident power will increase the range of passive backscatter systems and improve performance in fading environments.
T19.1	traffic optimization	2114867054	T19.1_2114867054_1	Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) have recently gained wide attention as a way to provide Internet connectivity in hard-to-reach areas as well as in big cities.
T19.1	traffic optimization	2114867054	T19.1_2114867054_2	The main problem of such networks is their limited bandwidth availability compared to wired networks.
T19.1	traffic optimization	2114867054	T19.1_2114867054_3	Hence, efficient usage of available communication resources is of crucial importance for WMNs.
T19.1	traffic optimization	2114867054	T19.1_2114867054_4	Peer-to-peer applications, these days, produce a considerable amount of traffic over the Internet.
T19.1	traffic optimization	2114867054	T19.1_2114867054_5	Such applications build their own overlay network by not taking into account the topology and the status of the underlying infrastructure, so causing an inefficient utilization of physical communication resources.
T19.1	traffic optimization	2114867054	T19.1_2114867054_6	This problem is particularly severe for Wireless Mesh Networks.
T19.1	traffic optimization	2114867054	T19.1_2114867054_7	In this paper we propose a cross-layer solution for P2P Bittorrent traffic optimization in WMNs, based on the ALTO (Application Layer Traffic Optimization) Service recently defined by the IETF.
T19.1	traffic optimization	2114867054	T19.1_2114867054_8	Our solution is able to significantly optimize Bittorrent traffic and it does not require any modification to the Bittorrent application.
T19.1	traffic optimization	2114867054	T19.1_2114867054_9	The tests we performed show a reduction of about 27% of download time and a reduction of about 66% of traffic crossing the WMN borders.
T19.2	genetic algorithm	2511808037	T19.2_2511808037_1	Software testing is one of the most inevitable processes in software development.
T19.2	genetic algorithm	2511808037	T19.2_2511808037_2	The field of software testing has seen an extensive use of search based techniques in the last decade.
T19.2	genetic algorithm	2511808037	T19.2_2511808037_3	Among the search based techniques, it is the metaheuristic techniques such as genetic algorithm that has garnered the major share of attention from researchers.
T19.2	genetic algorithm	2511808037	T19.2_2511808037_4	Looking at the large body of work that has happened and is happening in this field, we feel that it is high time someone studied how well genetic algorithm based techniques fare in practical testing process.
T19.2	genetic algorithm	2511808037	T19.2_2511808037_5	Method: In this work, we present a roadmap to the future of genetic algorithm based software testing, based on a review of literature.
T19.2	genetic algorithm	2511808037	T19.2_2511808037_6	We have mainly reviewed the works which use genetic algorithm for software test data generation.
T19.2	genetic algorithm	2511808037	T19.2_2511808037_7	This independent review is designed to direct the attention of future researchers to the deficiencies of genetic algorithm based testing, their possible solutions and the extent to which they are correctable.
T19.2	genetic algorithm	2511808037	T19.2_2511808037_8	The observations from the selected primary studies highlight the issues faced when genetic algorithm is applied in software testing.
T19.2	genetic algorithm	2511808037	T19.2_2511808037_9	The observations form the review reveal that the type of genetic algorithm used, fitness function design, population initialization and parameter settings does impact the quality of solution obtained in software testing using genetic algorithm.
T19.2	genetic algorithm	2511808037	T19.2_2511808037_10	From the review we conclude that, more generalized approaches can make genetic algorithm based software testing one of the strongest methods in practical software testing.
T19.2	genetic algorithm	2511808037	T19.2_2511808037_11	We hope that, this review will be a major breakthrough in genetic algorithm based software testing field.
T19.2	genetic algorithm	2199032957	T19.2_2199032957_1	This paper focuses on accuracy and robustness of parameters inversion in probability integral method by genetic algorithm.
T19.2	genetic algorithm	2199032957	T19.2_2199032957_2	For this, uniform design experimental method, subsidence prediction software and genetic algorithm program are used.
T19.2	genetic algorithm	2199032957	T19.2_2199032957_3	Result shows that parameters in probability integral method can be retrieved precisely by genetic algorithm with relative errors of the retrieved parameters are less than 1.5%; retrieving parameters by genetic algorithm has a great applicability in different areas such as measuring errors, gross errors, loss of observation stations, etc.
T19.3	road accident	2027512737	T19.3_2027512737_1	Abstract Road accident analysis is not new.
T19.3	road accident	2027512737	T19.3_2027512737_2	It has come to attention as traffic fatalities had an explosive increase in the 50u0027s and 60u0027s, especially in the industrialized world and during the intense period of economic growth.
T19.3	road accident	2027512737	T19.3_2027512737_3	This paper examines the potential use of the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology in facilitating road accident analysis in Hong Kong.
T19.3	road accident	2027512737	T19.3_2027512737_4	Various point-pattern techniques are illustrated.
T19.3	road accident	2027512737	T19.3_2027512737_5	While GIS can extend the visualization and analytical capabilities, its implementation in Hong Kong would hinge upon more comprehensive planning in data acquisition and integration.
T19.3	road accident	2027512737	T19.3_2027512737_6	A master digital database on road systems of Hong Kong with a standardized structure and coherent naming conventions in both Chinese and English is fundamental to further GIS development in the area of road accident analysis.

G05.2	crispr	2161871693	G05.2_2161871693_1	Summary: Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based technologies have revolutionized human genome engineering and opened countless possibilities to basic science, synthetic biology and gene therapy.
G05.2	crispr	2161871693	G05.2_2161871693_2	Albeit the enormous potential of these tools, their performance is far from perfect.
G05.2	crispr	2161871693	G05.2_2161871693_3	It is essential to perform a posterior careful analysis of the gene editing experiment.

G05.2	crispr	2770474929	G05.2_2770474929_1	The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a creative and innovative gene editing biotechnology tool in genetic engineering.
G05.2	crispr	2770474929	G05.2_2770474929_2	Although several achievements have been attained using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, it is still a challenge to avoid off-target effects and improve the editing efficacy.
G05.2	crispr	2770474929	G05.2_2770474929_3	Previous efforts on evaluating the efficacy and designing the guide RNA mainly focused on DNA properties.
G05.2	crispr	2770474929	G05.2_2770474929_4	However, some DNA features have not been characterized but can be reflected by protein properties, such as the disorder features and the sequence conservation.
G05.2	crispr	2770474929	G05.2_2770474929_5	In this paper, we provided a computational framework to identify important features related to the efficacy of CRISPR/Cas9 focusing on the properties of the proteins encoded by the target DNA fragments.
G05.2	crispr	2770474929	G05.2_2770474929_6	The feature selection method, maximal-relevance-minimal-redundancy, was adopted to analyze these features.
G05.2	crispr	2770474929	G05.2_2770474929_7	And incremental feature selection together with support vector machine, were employed to extract optimal features, on which an optimal classifier can be constructed.
G05.2	crispr	2770474929	G05.2_2770474929_8	As a result, 152 important features were extracted, with which an optimal classifier based on support vector machine was built.
G05.2	crispr	2770474929	G05.2_2770474929_9	This classifier obtained the highest MCC value of 0.355.
G05.2	crispr	2770474929	G05.2_2770474929_10	Finally, a series of detailed biological analyses were performed on the optimal features.
G05.2	crispr	2770474929	G05.2_2770474929_11	From the results, we found that some key factors may differentially affect the binding activity of sgRNAs to their targets.
G05.2	crispr	2770474929	G05.2_2770474929_12	Among them, the disorder status of the target protein sequences was found to be a major factor that is related to the efficacy of sgRNAs, suggesting the DNA features associated with the protein disorder status could also affect the CRISPR/Cas9 efficacy.
G05.2	crispr	2888304237	G05.2_2888304237_1	" :[0],""of hits from independent CRISPR or siRNA screens is poor."
G05.2	crispr	2888304237	G05.2_2888304237_2	This is partly due to data normalization primarily addressing technical variability within independent screens, and not the technical differences between them.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2804740007	G07.2_2804740007_1	Fake news has become a major societal issue and a technical chal- lenge for social media companies to identify.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2804740007	G07.2_2804740007_2	"This content is dif- cult to identify because the term ""fake news"" covers intention- ally false, deceptive stories as well as factual errors, satire, and sometimes, stories that a person just does not like."
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2804740007	G07.2_2804740007_3	Addressing the problem requires clear de nitions and examples.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2804740007	G07.2_2804740007_4	In this work, we present a dataset of fake news and satire stories that are hand coded, veri ed, and, in the case of fake news, include rebutting stories.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2804740007	G07.2_2804740007_5	We also include a thematic content analysis of the articles, identifying major themes that include hyperbolic support or con- demnation of a gure, conspiracy theories, racist themes, and dis- crediting of reliable sources.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2804740007	G07.2_2804740007_6	In addition to releasing this dataset for research use, we analyze it and show results based on language that are promising for classi cation purposes.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2804740007	G07.2_2804740007_7	Overall, our contri- bution of a dataset and initial analysis are designed to support fu- ture work by fake news researchers.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_1	We are told the Web is different from previous mass communication technologies because its technical affordances have created an informational “Wild West” (Reevell (2007)).
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_2	We are also told, that by overestimating their ‘savvy’, we have abandoned many young people to the risks of this frontier beyond regulation (Hargittai, 2010) (boyd, 2014) (Livingstone, 2007).
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_3	Young people are therefore said to be vulnerable to untruths circulating on the Web such as health misinformation (Levin-Zamir, Lemish, u0026 Gofin, 2011) (Hargittai u0026 Young, 2012) and conspiracy theories (Millar, 2012).
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_4	The advertised remedy for these problem populations of digitally illiterate youths is a programme of re-education.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_5	I begin by examining these claims to show the way we have constructed and investigated this problem has shaped our claims about young people online.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_6	I argue, in our drive to locate problem populations, we have reduced young people’s relationship with the Web to a series of reductive summative judgments that blame the Web or young people for their lack of digital information literacy.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_7	If we accept the current orthodoxy and then blame the Web we offer a technological determinist explanation of reality: technology produces misinformed populations.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_8	If we locate the problem solely with young people, as many researchers do, we evoke a legacy of bio-physiological conceptions of youth’s deficiencies.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_9	Our social explanations often attribute young people’s deficiencies to their parent’s occupation (the typical proxy in this research domain for socio-economic status) or their ethnicity; but these reduce young people to unreflective victims of structural inequality.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_10	I begin by conceptually distancing my research from positivistic methods such as tests and questionnaires that often confirm young people’s relatively powerless position in society (Morrow u0026 Richards, 1996); particularly when these methods result in binary judgments such as ‘unskilled’ or ‘skilled’.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_11	I then conceive of young people’s status as a social construct that affects their sense of self while they behave as active agents negotiating their position in society.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_12	Similarly, I reconceptualise hitherto fixed categories of information, misinformation, and disinformation as dynamic and socially-produced.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_13	I then position this unstable form of information within Foucauldian descriptions of the relationship between informational truths and the production of power in our society.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_14	I operationalise these new concepts of youth and information in this domain by using Mason’s (2011) facet methodology and mixed qualitative and digital ethnographic techniques.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_15	This combination of concepts (of youth, information, and power) and my research methods, allowed me to investigate the multidirectional and situational environmental and social influences (including my research methods) on youth’s engagements with information on the Web.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_16	My findings show that we cannot effectively isolate and implicate the Web, young people, or their socio-economic status as explanations of why and how young people use the Web for information.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_17	In analysing the data I began by looking for a conceptual framework that would account for the entanglements of technology, people, and society.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_18	This study identifies and analyses how young people’s web practices are defined by “the possibilities and impossibilities” (Bourdieu 1984, p100) that exist within young people’s educational fields and beyond.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_19	Although learning new skills is always important, the social context in which these skills are acquired and used is crucial.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_20	The social environment influences which skills are naturalised, incentivised, and rewarded.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_21	This thesis focuses on this space where, buffeted by the various vested interests who are concerned about how the Web is being utilised; young people are exercising their agency and using the Web in ways that suit their purposes.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_22	My research has found young people are not free to use the Web as they please nor do they always consciously or critically reflect on their own practices, yet they do describe complex patterns of usage that help them explore their sense of self as well as society’s norms and values.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_23	My data shows young people’s Web usage emerges from the tensions between: how they want to use the Web; how they have learnt to use it; how they have been taught to use it; how they have been allowed to use it; and how these tensions are played-out in context of their contingent social reality.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2471386133	G07.2_2471386133_24	In short, this thesis aims to repatriate young people’s web practices from the sterile, positivist methods space of questionnaires and tests of digital literacy to social contexts of everyday life.

G03.1	smart speaker	2977717854	G03.1_2977717854_1	Smart speakers (such as Amazon Echo and Google Home) are becoming a popular addition to homes, and it is expected that they will be used as parental support in the future.
G03.1	smart speaker	2977717854	G03.1_2977717854_2	Previous studies have analyzed the history logs of the uses of their services and gathered impressions of them using questionnaire surveys and qualitative interviews.
G03.1	smart speaker	2977717854	G03.1_2977717854_3	Details of how children interact with smart speakers have not been fully investigated.
G03.1	smart speaker	2977717854	G03.1_2977717854_4	This study investigated childrenu0027s interactions with an utterance-output device, such as a smart speaker, and focuses on the influences of the childrenu0027s personality traits.
G03.1	smart speaker	2977717854	G03.1_2977717854_5	The experiment was conducted in a realistic setting.
G03.1	smart speaker	2977717854	G03.1_2977717854_6	The results indicate that the less nervous, more emotionally stable, or more adaptable to communication different from that at home children are, the more closely they engage in conversational play with an utterance-output device.
G03.1	smart speaker	2977717854	G03.1_2977717854_7	The findings suggest that effective conversational play, which can lessen anxiety toward a novel utterance-output device, will be required in future interaction design.
G04.1	drug discovery	2170915616	G04.1_2170915616_1	Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are challenging but attractive targets of small molecule drugs for therapeutic interventions of human diseases.
G04.1	drug discovery	2170915616	G04.1_2170915616_2	In this era of rapid accumulation of PPI data, there is great need for a methodology that can efficiently select drug target PPIs by holistically assessing the druggability of PPIs.
G04.1	drug discovery	2170915616	G04.1_2170915616_3	To address this need, we propose here a novel approach based on a supervised machine-learning method, support vector machine (SVM).
G04.3	infectious diseases	2888682363	G04.3_2888682363_1	We recently developed the Genomics Research Integration System (GRIS) to help NIAID investigators at the NIH leverage both phenotypic and genotypic patient data to identify causal variants for rare diseases.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2888682363	G04.3_2888682363_2	The project is a bioinformatics compliment to an initiative to sequence exomes for all NIAID patients visiting the NIH Clinical Center.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2888682363	G04.3_2888682363_3	The system is designed to serve as a valuable resource for clinical genomic data annotated with standardized phenotypic terms using the Human Phenotype Ontology \citeKohler2013.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2888682363	G04.3_2888682363_4	GRIS uses PhenoTips® \citeGirdea2013 to capture clinical records and family pedigrees which are linked to genomic records stored in a genetic analysis tool,seqr, developed at the Broad Institute (\urlseqr.broadinstitute.org ) to enable causal variant identification.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2888682363	G04.3_2888682363_5	"We have customized both programs in novel ways to meet NIH encryption requirements, to link patient records across programs in a controlled manner, and to provide ""tiers"" of access so that individual research groups can customize usersu0027 ability to edit their patient records and view personally identifiable information (PII)."
G04.3	infectious diseases	2888682363	G04.3_2888682363_6	A challenge faced by shared clinical data repositories is to facilitate maximal collective research value of data through open sharing, while respecting the needs of researchers to adjust access to patient data in accordance with research goals and subject to clinical sharing guidelines.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2888682363	G04.3_2888682363_7	We devised a technical approach to meet the needs of sharing policies, formulated collectively by researchers and clinicians, to promote wider acceptance and usage of the system.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2888682363	G04.3_2888682363_8	Accordingly, we implemented a patient identifier mapping system in conjunction with automated notifications to enable transparent sharing.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2888682363	G04.3_2888682363_9	Our approach may prove helpful to other hospital or clinical support systems seeking to respect the confidentiality of patient PII and early findings of individual researchers, while recognizing that data repositories are most primed for discovery (and can significantly increase return on investment) if they are open and accessible to a larger research community.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2092395555	G04.3_2092395555_1	In this paper, we present a fully automatic method to quantify Tree-in-Bud (TIB) patterns for respiratory tract infections.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2092395555	G04.3_2092395555_2	The proposed quantification method is based on our previous effort to detect and track TIB patterns with a computer assisted detection (CAD) system [9].
G04.3	infectious diseases	2092395555	G04.3_2092395555_3	In addition to accurately identifying TIB on CT, quantifying TIB is important for measuring the volume of affected lung as a potantial marker of disease severity.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2092395555	G04.3_2092395555_4	This quantification can be challenging due to the complex shape of TIB and high intensity variation contributing mixed features.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2092395555	G04.3_2092395555_5	Our proposed quantification method is based on a local scale concept such that TIB regions detected via the CAD system are quantified adaptively, and volume percentages of the quantified regions are compared to visual scoring of participating radiologists.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2092395555	G04.3_2092395555_6	We conducted the experiments with a data set of 94 chest CTs (laboratory confirmed 39 viral bronchiolitis caused by human parainfluenza (HPIV), 34 nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM), and 21 normal control).
G04.3	infectious diseases	2092395555	G04.3_2092395555_7	Experimental results show that the proposed quantification system is well suited to the CAD system for detecting TIB patterns.
G04.3	infectious diseases	2092395555	G04.3_2092395555_8	Correlations of observer-CAD agreements are reported as (R2 = 0.824, p u003c 0.01) and (R2 = 0.801, p u003c 0.01) for HPIV and NTM cases, respectively.

G14.2	end to end encryption	2755345740	G14.2_2755345740_1	Due to increased government surveillance as well as data breaches, end-to-end encryption has recently received an increasing attention as a way to protect against such threats.
G14.2	end to end encryption	2755345740	G14.2_2755345740_2	End-to-end (E2E) encryption preserve the confidentiality of data on the wire as well as from service providers by performing encryption/decryption at clients keeping the keys strictly within client devices.
G14.2	end to end encryption	2755345740	G14.2_2755345740_3	There are many variants of end-to-end encryption schemes for different communication patterns.
G14.2	end to end encryption	2755345740	G14.2_2755345740_4	In this paper, we systematically analyze the security of these different variants against three types of passive adversaries and one type of active adversaries.
G14.2	end to end encryption	2755345740	G14.2_2755345740_5	We show that the security of some of these systems are broken under these threat models and what can be done to ensure confidentiality in such systems.
G14.2	end to end encryption	2755345740	G14.2_2755345740_6	We also analyze the existing products in the market and show what level of security they provide.
G14.2	end to end encryption	2755345740	G14.2_2755345740_7	Our study shows that most of the E2E encrypted systems are secure against only the weakest passive adversaries.
G14.2	end to end encryption	2755345740	G14.2_2755345740_8	Further, these systems are broken not by cryptanalysis of underlying cryptographic algorithms but by flawed system designs and security assumptions.
G14.2	end to end encryption	2755345740	G14.2_2755345740_9	Specifically we identify that unencrypted metadata and access patterns make these systems susceptible to inference attacks.
G14.2	end to end encryption	2755345740	G14.2_2755345740_10	We conclude with general design guidelines to securely build such systems.
G14.2	end to end encryption	2581267718	G14.2_2581267718_1	WhatsApp messenger is arguably the most popular mobile app available on all smart-phones.

G14.2	end to end encryption	2581267718	G14.2_2581267718_3	In April 2016, WhatsApp switched to a default end-to-end encrypted service.
G14.2	end to end encryption	2581267718	G14.2_2581267718_4	This means that all messages (SMS), phone calls, videos, audios, and any other form of information exchanged cannot be read by any unauthorized entity since WhatsApp.
G14.2	end to end encryption	2581267718	G14.2_2581267718_5	In this paper we analyze the WhatsApp messaging platform and critique its security architecture along with a focus on its privacy preservation mechanisms.

G14.2	end to end encryption	2581267718	G14.2_2581267718_7	Finally, we argue that simply encrypting the end-to-end channel cannot preserve privacy.
G14.2	end to end encryption	2581267718	G14.2_2581267718_8	The metadata can reveal just enough information to show connections between people, their patterns, and personal information.

G14.2	end to end encryption	227257839	G14.2_227257839_1	Security and privacy have turned out to be major challenges of the further Internet evolution in general and cloud computing, in particular.
G14.2	end to end encryption	227257839	G14.2_227257839_2	This paper proposes a novel approach as to how to safeguard against previously unimpeded insider attacks, referred to as Sealed Cloud.
G14.2	end to end encryption	227257839	G14.2_227257839_3	A canonical set of technical measures is described, which, in conjunction, sufficiently complicate and thus economically prevent insider access to unencrypted data.

G14.2	end to end encryption	227257839	G14.2_227257839_5	Another application of the Sealed Cloud, referred to as Sealed Freeze, provides a seminal solution to privacy issues pertaining to data retention.
G14.2	end to end encryption	1603537120	G14.2_1603537120_1	In usual communication networks, the network operator or an intruder could easily observe when, how much and with whom the users communicate (traffic analysis), even if the users employ end-to-end encryption.
G14.2	end to end encryption	1603537120	G14.2_1603537120_2	When ISDNs are used for almost everything, this becomes a severe threat.
G14.2	end to end encryption	1603537120	G14.2_1603537120_3	Therefore, we summarize basic concepts to keep the recipient and sender or at least their relationship unobservable, consider some possible implementations and necessary hierarchical extensions, and propose some suitable performance and reliability enhancements.
G14.2	end to end encryption	1982799406	G14.2_1982799406_1	The number of instant messages sent per year now exceeds that of email.

G18.1	peer recomendations	2076332737	G18.1_2076332737_1	We explore models of social influence in an open multi-agent system market scenario.Consumer choice is informed by peer recommendations in an evolving social network.We compare the behaviour of two algorithms for selecting recommending peers.We study the link between selection algorithms and the emergent network topologies.We study the impact of the peer selection algorithms on the agentsu0027 performance.
G18.1	peer recomendations	2076332737	G18.1_2076332737_2	Open multi-agent systems are typically formed from heterogeneous peers operating in a decentralised manner.
G18.1	peer recomendations	2076332737	G18.1_2076332737_3	Hence, their constituent agents must evaluate possible actions and opportunities based on local, subjective knowledge.
G18.1	peer recomendations	2076332737	G18.1_2076332737_4	When agents have insufficient personal experience, they may inevitably rely on their social connections to act as a source of relevant information or recommendations.
G18.1	peer recomendations	2076332737	G18.1_2076332737_5	We describe an agent-mediated electronic market for investigating social interaction within the context of evolving heterogeneous distributed networks.
G18.1	peer recomendations	2076332737	G18.1_2076332737_6	In our scenario, consumers look for appropriate services and this service choice is informed via peer recommendations.
G18.1	peer recomendations	2076332737	G18.1_2076332737_7	We define two alternative algorithms for selecting peers based on perceived similarity and we evaluate them on their ability to organise an overlay network such that it acts as a passive filter, tailoring the information that agents use to select services in the market.
G18.1	peer recomendations	2076332737	G18.1_2076332737_8	We use this scenario to explore the link between the peer selection algorithms and the emergent network topologies, as well as the impact of the peer selection algorithm on the agentsu0027 performance in choosing services based on peer recommendations.
G18.1	peer recomendations	2076332737	G18.1_2076332737_9	Our simulation results demonstrate a qualitative difference in the behaviour of the algorithms, with optimal algorithm selection relying on information regarding the preferences of the wider population of agents.
T04.3	nematode	2085701063	T04.3_2085701063_1	One of the most tractable organisms for the study of nervous systems is the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, whose locomotion in particular has been the subject of a number of models.
T04.3	nematode	2085701063	T04.3_2085701063_2	In this paper we present a first integrated neuro-mechanical model of forward locomotion.
T04.3	nematode	2085701063	T04.3_2085701063_3	We find that a previous neural model is robust to the addition of a body with mechanical properties, and that the integrated model produces oscillations with a more realistic frequency and waveform than the neural model alone.
T04.3	nematode	2085701063	T04.3_2085701063_4	We conclude that the body and environment are likely to be important components of the wormu0027s locomotion subsystem.

T09.3	text classification	1483825771	T09.3_1483825771_4	The results show the relevance of part-of-speech information for the pre-processing phase of text classification allowing for a strong reduction of the number of features needed in the text classification.
T09.3	text classification	1582442103	T09.3_1582442103_1	Automated text classification has been considered as an important method to manage and process a huge amount of documents in digital forms that are widespread and continuously increasing.

T09.3	text classification	1582442103	T09.3_1582442103_3	However, most of the investigations in text classification are studied not on real data but on well-organized text corpus, and do not show their usefulness.
T09.3	text classification	1582442103	T09.3_1582442103_4	This paper suggests and analyzes text classification method for a real application, FAQ text classification task, by combining multiple classifiers.
T09.3	text classification	1582442103	T09.3_1582442103_5	We propose two methods of combining multiple neural networks that improve performance by maximum combining and neural network combining.

T09.3	text classification	2026607267	T09.3_2026607267_1	Abstract   In this paper, a classification method named explicit Markov model is applied for text classification.
T09.3	text classification	2026607267	T09.3_2026607267_2	Currently some machine learning technologies, such as support vector machine (SVM), have been discussed widely in text classification.
T09.3	text classification	2026607267	T09.3_2026607267_3	However, these methods consider that any two features are independent and ignore the language structure information.
T09.3	text classification	2026607267	T09.3_2026607267_4	Hidden Markov model is a powerful tool for sequence tagging problems.
T09.3	text classification	2026607267	T09.3_2026607267_5	This paper presents a new method called explicit Markov model (EMM) which is based on HMM for text classification.
T09.3	text classification	2026607267	T09.3_2026607267_6	EMM make better use of the context information between the observation symbols.
T09.3	text classification	2026607267	T09.3_2026607267_7	Our experiments are conducted on three datasets: Reuteru0027s 21578 R8 dataset, WebKB and Fudan University Chinese text classification corpus.
T09.3	text classification	2026607267	T09.3_2026607267_8	Experimental results show that the performance of EMM is comparable to SVM for text classification.
T10.4	vision sensor	2081644865	T10.4_2081644865_1	This paper presents a complete traffic sign recognition system based on vision sensor onboard a moving vehicle which detects and recognizes up to one hundred of the most important road signs, including circular and triangular signs.
T10.4	vision sensor	2081644865	T10.4_2081644865_2	A restricted Hough transform is used as detection method from the information extracted in contour images, while the proposed recognition system is based on Support Vector Machines (SVM).
T10.4	vision sensor	2081644865	T10.4_2081644865_3	A novel solution to the problem of discarding detected signs that do not pertain to the host road is proposed.
T10.4	vision sensor	2081644865	T10.4_2081644865_4	For that purpose infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) communication and a stereo vision sensor are used.
T10.4	vision sensor	2081644865	T10.4_2081644865_5	Furthermore, the outputs provided by the vision sensor and the data supplied by the CAN Bus and a GPS sensor are combined to obtain the global position of the detected traffic signs, which is used to identify a traffic sign in the I2V communication.
T10.4	vision sensor	2081644865	T10.4_2081644865_6	This paper presents plenty of tests in real driving conditions, both day and night, in which an average detection rate over 95% and an average recognition rate around 93% were obtained with an average runtime of 35 ms that allows real-time performance.
T12.3	diagnosis	1501799430	T12.3_1501799430_1	We propose a novel multiple-instance learning(MIL) algorithm for designing classifiers for use in computer aided detection(CAD).
T12.3	diagnosis	1501799430	T12.3_1501799430_2	The proposed algorithm has 3 advantages over classical methods.
T12.3	diagnosis	1501799430	T12.3_1501799430_3	First, unlike traditional learning algorithms that minimize the candidate level misclassification error, the proposed algorithm directly optimizes the patient-wise sensitivity.
T12.3	diagnosis	1501799430	T12.3_1501799430_4	Second, this algorithm automatically selects a small subset of statistically useful features.
T12.3	diagnosis	1501799430	T12.3_1501799430_5	Third, this algorithm is very fast, utilizes all of the available training data (without the need for cross-validation etc.
T12.3	diagnosis	1501799430	T12.3_1501799430_6	), and requires no human hand tuning or intervention.
T12.3	diagnosis	1501799430	T12.3_1501799430_7	Experimentally the algorithm is more accurate than state of the art support vector machine (SVM) classifier, and substantially reduces the number of features that have to be computed.

T12.4	healthcare	184272183	T12.4_184272183_1	Personal Health Records (PHRs) are a rapidly expanding area of medical informatics due to the belief that they may improve health care delivery and control costs of care.
T12.4	healthcare	184272183	T12.4_184272183_2	The PHRs in use or in development today support a myriad of different functions, and consequently offer different value propositions.
T12.4	healthcare	184272183	T12.4_184272183_3	A comprehensive value analysis of PHRs has never been conducted; such analysis is needed to identify those PHR functions that yield the greatest value to PHR stakeholders.
T12.4	healthcare	184272183	T12.4_184272183_4	Here we present a framework that could serve as a foundation for determining the value of PHR functions and thereby help optimize PHR development.
T12.4	healthcare	184272183	T12.4_184272183_5	While the value framework is specific to the domain of PHRs, the authors have successfully applied the associated evaluation methodology in assessing other health care information technologies.
T13.1	fairness	2363800589	T13.1_2363800589_1	Networks need to provide consistent end-to-end Quality of Service to all new applicants in packet-switched networks.End-to-end QoS and system fairness are improved by a network proportional fairness scheduling strategy(nPFS) using proportionally differentiated services.The strategy integrates several objects such as the network performance,useru0027s QoS requirements,and system fairness with the proportional fairness principle to provide end-to-end traffic control that satisfies multiple performance objectives and system fairness.Simulations show that the network proportional fairness scheduling strategy efficiently guarantees proportional fairness in multiplex service classes,especially the end-to-end quality of service proportional fairness.
T13.1	fairness	1557876268	T13.1_1557876268_1	In modeling a concurrent system, fairness constraints are usually considered at a specific granularity level of the system, leading to many different variants of fairness: transition fairness, object/process fairness, actor fairness, etc.
T13.1	fairness	1557876268	T13.1_1557876268_2	These different notions of fairness can be unified by making explicit their parametrization over the relevant entities in the system as universal quantification.
T13.1	fairness	1557876268	T13.1_1557876268_3	We propose a state/event-based framework as well as an on-the-fly model checking algorithm to verify LTL properties under universally quantified parametric fairness assumptions, specified by generalized strong/weak fairness formulas.

T16.1	credit card fraud	2612056740	T16.1_2612056740_2	In this paper, we proposed the use of six known models, namely, decision tree, random forest, Bayesian network, Naive Bayes, support vector machine, and K* models, to form an ensemble for the detection of credit card fraud.
T16.1	credit card fraud	2612056740	T16.1_2612056740_3	We focused on the voting mechanisms used by the ensemble and proposed optimistic, pessimistic, and weighted voting strategies.
T16.1	credit card fraud	2612056740	T16.1_2612056740_4	The proposed model is called optimistic, pessimistic, and weighted voting in an ensemble of models.
T16.1	credit card fraud	2612056740	T16.1_2612056740_5	A dataset of real credit card transactions from a leading bank in Turkey was used to evaluate the performance of optimistic, pessimistic, and weighted voting in an ensemble of models.
T16.1	credit card fraud	2612056740	T16.1_2612056740_6	The results showed that the optimistic voting strategy enables the detection of 31.59% of fraudulent transactions with a false alarm rate of only 0.10%, the pessimistic voting strategy detects 93.92% of fraudulent transactions with a false alarm rate of 13.72%, and the weighted voting strategy detects 64.02% of fraudulent transactions with a false alarm rate of 0.75%.
T16.1	credit card fraud	2612056740	T16.1_2612056740_7	Banks can choose among these voting mechanisms depending on their preferred strategies for fraud detection and desired false alarm rates.
T16.1	credit card fraud	2045049630	T16.1_2045049630_1	Credit card fraud is a serious and growing problem.
T16.1	credit card fraud	2045049630	T16.1_2045049630_2	While predictive models for credit card fraud detection are in active use in practice, reported studies on the use of data mining approaches for credit card fraud detection are relatively few, possibly due to the lack of available data for research.
T16.1	credit card fraud	2045049630	T16.1_2045049630_3	This paper evaluates two advanced data mining approaches, support vector machines and random forests, together with the well-known logistic regression, as part of an attempt to better detect (and thus control and prosecute) credit card fraud.

G07.2	conspiracy theories	2039222427	G07.2_2039222427_3	Pages are categorized, according to their topics and the communities of interests they pertain to, in (a) alternative information sources (diffusing topics that are neglected by science and main stream media); (b) online political activism; and (c) main stream media.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2039222427	G07.2_2039222427_4	We show that attention patterns are similar despite the different qualitative nature of the information, meaning that unsubstantiated claims (mainly conspiracy theories) reverberate for as long as other information.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2039222427	G07.2_2039222427_5	Finally, we classify users according to their interaction patterns among the different topics and measure how they responded to the injection of 2788 false information.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2039222427	G07.2_2039222427_6	Our analysis reveals that users which are prominently interacting with conspiracists information sources are more prone to interact with intentional false claims.

G07.2	conspiracy theories	2253498108	G07.2_2253498108_1	Online video-sharing sites such as YouTube are very popular and also used by a lot of people to obtain knowledge and information, also on science, health and technology.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2253498108	G07.2_2253498108_2	Technically they could be valuable tools for the public communication of science and technology, but the users of YouTube are also confronted with conspiracy theories and erroneous and misleading information that deviates from scientific consensus views.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2253498108	G07.2_2253498108_3	This contribution details the results of a study that investigates what kind of information users find when they are searching for climate science and climate manipulation topics on YouTube and whether this information corresponds with or challenges scientific consensus views.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2253498108	G07.2_2253498108_4	An innovative methodological approach using the anonymization network Tor is introduced for drawing randomized samples of YouTube videos.

G07.2	conspiracy theories	2294382086	G07.2_2294382086_2	This Big Data holds promises of new insights, unparalleled innovation, even artificial intelligence.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2294382086	G07.2_2294382086_3	"However, the ubiquity and availability of data connected to our human desire to see patterns where none exist means that humans have to deal with increasing amounts of meaningless data analysis, ""fact-based"" conspiracy theories and click-bait infographics."
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2296706733	G07.2_2296706733_1	Massive amounts of misinformation have been observed to spread in uncontrolled fashion across social media.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2296706733	G07.2_2296706733_10	With the increasing risks connected to massive online misinformation, social news observatories have the potential to help researchers, journalists, and the general public understand the dynamics of real and fake news sharing.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2296706733	G07.2_2296706733_2	Examples include rumors, hoaxes, fake news, and conspiracy theories.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2296706733	G07.2_2296706733_3	At the same time, several journalistic organizations devote significant efforts to high-quality fact checking of online claims.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2296706733	G07.2_2296706733_4	The resulting information cascades contain instances of both accurate and inaccurate information, unfold over multiple time scales, and often reach audiences of considerable size.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2296706733	G07.2_2296706733_5	All these factors pose challenges for the study of the social dynamics of online news sharing.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2296706733	G07.2_2296706733_6	Here we introduce Hoaxy, a platform for the collection, detection, and analysis of online misinformation and its related fact-checking efforts.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2296706733	G07.2_2296706733_7	We discuss the design of the platform and present a preliminary analysis of a sample of public tweets containing both fake news and fact checking.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2296706733	G07.2_2296706733_8	We find that, in the aggregate, the sharing of fact-checking content typically lags that of misinformation by 10-20 hours.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2296706733	G07.2_2296706733_9	Moreover, fake news are dominated by very active users, while fact checking is a more grass-roots activity.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2402988752	G07.2_2402988752_1	Despite widespread political conspiracy theories about Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, a majority of partisans continue to distance themselves from such beliefs.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2402988752	G07.2_2402988752_2	Even so, the ideological biases that drive conspiratorial thinking may be hard to overcome.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2402988752	G07.2_2402988752_3	In this study, we examine the unintentional endorsement of conspiratorial beliefs as revealed in movement dynamics.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2402988752	G07.2_2402988752_4	We track the cursor movements of Republicans and Democrats as they click target regions on their computer screens, ostensibly providing bias-free opinions (e.g., clicking “FALSE” upon reading “Barack Obama was born in Kenya”).
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2402988752	G07.2_2402988752_5	However, during these response movements, we find inhibition and movement attraction to regions of the screen where a competitor response is located (e.g., “TRUE” for the “birther” conspiracy).
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2402988752	G07.2_2402988752_6	These dynamics are not present for general conspiracies or political knowledge items.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2402988752	G07.2_2402988752_7	Though both Republicans and Democrats show evidence of implicit biases, changes in the strength of competition also reveal key asymmetrical differences.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2527044893	G07.2_2527044893_1	The massive diffusion of online social media allows for the rapid and uncontrolled spreading of conspiracy theories, hoaxes, unsubstantiated claims, and false news.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2527044893	G07.2_2527044893_2	Such an impressive amount of misinformation can influence policy preferences and encourage behaviors strongly divergent from recommended practices.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2527044893	G07.2_2527044893_3	In this paper, we study the statistical properties of viral misinformation in online social media.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2527044893	G07.2_2527044893_4	By means of methods belonging to Extreme Value Theory, we show that the number of extremely viral posts over time follows a homogeneous Poisson process, and that the interarrival times between such posts are independent and identically distributed, following an exponential distribution.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2527044893	G07.2_2527044893_5	Moreover, we characterize the uncertainty around the rate parameter of the Poisson process through Bayesian methods.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2527044893	G07.2_2527044893_6	Finally, we are able to derive the predictive posterior probability distribution of the number of posts exceeding a certain threshold of shares over a finite interval of time.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2532284773	G07.2_2532284773_1	Misinformation under the form of rumor, hoaxes, and conspiracy theories spreads on social media at alarming rates.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2532284773	G07.2_2532284773_2	One hypothesis is that, since social media are shaped by homophily, belief in misinformation may be more likely to thrive on those social circles that are segregated from the rest of the network.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2532284773	G07.2_2532284773_3	One possible antidote to misinformation is fact checking which, however, does not always stop rumors from spreading further, owing to selective exposure and our limited attention.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2532284773	G07.2_2532284773_4	What are the conditions under which factual verification are effective at containing the spreading of misinformation?
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2532284773	G07.2_2532284773_5	Here we take into account the combination of selective exposure due to network segregation, forgetting (i.e., finite memory), and fact-checking.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2532284773	G07.2_2532284773_6	We consider a compartmental model of two interacting epidemic processes over a network that is segregated between gullible and skeptic users.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2532284773	G07.2_2532284773_7	Extensive simulation and mean-field analysis show that a more segregated network facilitates the spread of a hoax only at low forgetting rates, but has no effect when agents forget at faster rates.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2532284773	G07.2_2532284773_8	This finding may inform the development of mitigation techniques and raise awareness on the risks of uncontrolled misinformation online.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2539931556	G07.2_2539931556_1	Online Social Networks explode with activity whenever a crisis event takes place.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2539931556	G07.2_2539931556_2	Most content generated as part of this activity is a mixture of text and images, and is particularly useful for first responders to identify popular topics of interest and gauge the pulse and sentiment of citizens.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2539931556	G07.2_2539931556_3	While multiple researchers have used text to identify, analyze and measure themes and public sentiment during such events, little work has explored visual themes floating on networks in the form of images, and the sentiment inspired by them.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2539931556	G07.2_2539931556_4	Given the potential of visual content for influencing usersu0027 thoughts and emotions, we perform a large scale analysis to compare popular themes and sentiment across images and textual content posted on Facebook during the terror attacks that took place in Paris in 2015.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2539931556	G07.2_2539931556_5	Using state-of-the-art image summarization techniques, we discovered multiple visual themes which were popular in images, but were not identifiable through text.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2539931556	G07.2_2539931556_6	We uncovered instances of misinformation and false flag (conspiracy) theories among popular image themes, which were not prominent in user generated textual content, and can be of particular inter- est to first responders.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2539931556	G07.2_2539931556_7	Our analysis also revealed that while textual content posted after the attacks reflected negative sentiment, images inspired positive sentiment.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2539931556	G07.2_2539931556_8	To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large scale study of images posted on social networks during a crisis event.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2572918643	G07.2_2572918643_1	Given the huge impact that Online Social Networks (OSN) had in the way people get informed and form their opinion, they became an attractive playground for malicious entities that want to spread misinformation, and leverage their effect.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2572918643	G07.2_2572918643_2	"In fact, misinformation easily spreads on OSN, and this is a huge threat for modern society, possibly influencing also the outcome of elections, or even putting peopleu0027s life at risk (e.g., spreading ""anti-vaccines"" misinformation)."
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2572918643	G07.2_2572918643_3	"Therefore, it is of paramount importance for our society to have some sort of ""validation"" on information spreading through OSN."
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2572918643	G07.2_2572918643_4	The need for a wide-scale validation would greatly benefit from automatic tools.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2572918643	G07.2_2572918643_5	In this paper, we show that it is difficult to carry out an automatic classification of misinformation considering only structural properties of content propagation cascades.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2572918643	G07.2_2572918643_6	We focus on structural properties, because they would be inherently difficult to be manipulated, with the the aim of circumventing classification systems.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2572918643	G07.2_2572918643_7	To support our claim, we carry out an extensive evaluation on Facebook posts belonging to conspiracy theories (representative of misinformation), and scientific news (representative of fact-checked content).
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2572918643	G07.2_2572918643_8	Our findings show that conspiracy content reverberates in a way which is hard to distinguish from scientific content: for the classification mechanism we investigated, classification F-score never exceeds 0.7.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2768838852	G07.2_2768838852_1	Extensive research has been conducted to identify, analyze and measure popular topics and public sentiment on Online Social Networks (OSNs) through text, especially during crisis events.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2768838852	G07.2_2768838852_2	However, little work has been done to understand such events through pictures posted on these networks.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2768838852	G07.2_2768838852_3	Given the potential of visual content for influencing usersu0027 thoughts and emotions, we perform a large-scale analysis to study and compare popular themes and sentiment across images and textual content posted on Facebook during the terror attacks that took place in Paris in 2015.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2768838852	G07.2_2768838852_4	We propose a generalizable and highly automated 3-tier pipeline which utilizes state-of-the-art computer vision techniques to extract high-level human understandable image descriptors.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2768838852	G07.2_2768838852_5	We used these descriptors to associate themes and sentiment with images, and analyzed over 57,000 images related to the Paris Attacks.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2768838852	G07.2_2768838852_6	We discovered multiple visual themes which were popular in images, but were not identifiable through text.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2768838852	G07.2_2768838852_7	We also uncovered instances of misinformation and false flag (conspiracy) theories among popular image themes, which were not prominent in user-generated textual content.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2768838852	G07.2_2768838852_8	Further, our analysis revealed that while textual content posted after the attacks reflected negative sentiment, images inspired positive sentiment.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2768838852	G07.2_2768838852_9	These findings suggest that large-scale mining of images posted on OSNs during crisis, and other news-making events can significantly augment textual content to understand such events.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2785127572	G07.2_2785127572_1	Conspiracy theories cover topics from politicians to world events.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2785127572	G07.2_2785127572_2	Frequently, proponents of conspiracies hold these beliefs strongly despite available evidence that may challenge or disprove them.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2785127572	G07.2_2785127572_3	Therefore, conspiratorial reasoning has often been described as illegitimate or flawed.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2785127572	G07.2_2785127572_4	Here, we explore the possibility of growing a rational (Bayesian) conspiracy theorist through an Agent-Based Model.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2785127572	G07.2_2785127572_5	The agent has reasonable constraints on access to the total information as well its access to the global population.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2785127572	G07.2_2785127572_6	The model shows that network structures are central to maintain objectively mistaken beliefs.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2785127572	G07.2_2785127572_7	Increasing the size of the available network, yielded increased confidence in mistaken beliefs and subsequent network pruning, allowing for belief purism.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2785127572	G07.2_2785127572_8	Rather than ameliorating and correcting mistaken beliefs (where agents move toward the correct mean), large networks appear to maintain and strengthen them.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2785127572	G07.2_2785127572_9	As such, large networks may increase the potential for belief polarization, extreme beliefs, and conspiratorial thinking – even amongst Bayesian agents.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2786771136	G07.2_2786771136_1	Social media provides political news and information for both active duty military personnel and veterans.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2786771136	G07.2_2786771136_2	We analyze the subgroups of Twitter and Facebook users who spend time consuming junk news from websites that target US military personnel and veterans with conspiracy theories, misinformation, and other forms of junk news about military affairs and national security issues.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2786771136	G07.2_2786771136_3	(1) Over Twitter we find that there are significant and persistent interactions between current and former military personnel and a broad network of extremist, Russia-focused, and international conspiracy subgroups.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2786771136	G07.2_2786771136_4	(2) Over Facebook, we find significant and persistent interactions between public pages for military and veterans and subgroups dedicated to political conspiracy, and both sides of the political spectrum.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2786771136	G07.2_2786771136_5	(3) Over Facebook, the users who are most interested in conspiracy theories and the political right seem to be distributing the most junk news, whereas users who are either in the military or are veterans are among the most sophisticated news consumers, and share very little junk news through the network.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2787296320	G07.2_2787296320_1	Abstract   The problem of detecting bots, automated social media accounts governed by software but disguising as human users, has strong implications.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2787296320	G07.2_2787296320_2	For example, bots have been used to sway political elections by distorting online discourse, to manipulate the stock market, or to push anti-vaccine conspiracy theories that may have caused health epidemics.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2787296320	G07.2_2787296320_3	Most techniques proposed to date detect bots at the account level, by processing large amounts of social media posts, and leveraging information from network structure, temporal dynamics, sentiment analysis, etc.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2787296320	G07.2_2787296320_4	In this paper, we propose a deep neural network based on contextual long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture that exploits both content and metadata to detect bots at the tweet level: contextual features are extracted from user metadata and fed as auxiliary input to LSTM deep nets processing the tweet text.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2787296320	G07.2_2787296320_5	Another contribution that we make is proposing a technique based on synthetic minority oversampling to generate a large labeled dataset, suitable for deep nets training, from a minimal amount of labeled data (roughly 3000 examples of sophisticated Twitter bots).
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2787296320	G07.2_2787296320_6	We demonstrate that, from just one single tweet, our architecture can achieve high classification accuracy (AUC  u003e  96%) in separating bots from humans.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2787296320	G07.2_2787296320_7	We apply the same architecture to account-level bot detection, achieving nearly perfect classification accuracy (AUC  u003e  99%).
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2787296320	G07.2_2787296320_8	Our system outperforms previous state of the art while leveraging a small and interpretable set of features, yet requiring minimal training data.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2795069772	G07.2_2795069772_1	The deluge of online and offline misinformation is overloading the exchange of ideas upon which democracies depend.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2795069772	G07.2_2795069772_2	Fake news, conspiracy theories, and deceptive social bots proliferate, facilitating the manipulation of public opinion.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2795069772	G07.2_2795069772_3	Countering misinformation while protecting freedom of speech will require collaboration across industry, journalism, and academia.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2795069772	G07.2_2795069772_4	The Workshop on Digital Misinformation — held in May 2017 in conjunction with the International Conference on Web and Social Media in Montreal, Quebec, Canada — was intended to foster these efforts.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2795069772	G07.2_2795069772_5	The meeting brought together more than 100 stakeholders from academia, media, and tech companies to discuss the research challenges implicit in building a trustworthy Web.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2795069772	G07.2_2795069772_6	Below we outline the main findings from the discussion.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2803291160	G07.2_2803291160_1	In this paper, we analyze the content of the most popular videos posted on YouTube in the first phase of the Zika-virus outbreak in 2016, and the user responses to those videos.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2803291160	G07.2_2803291160_2	More specifically, we examine the extent to which informational and conspiracy theory videos differ in terms of user activity (number of comments, shares, likes and dislikes), and the sentiment and content of the user responses.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2803291160	G07.2_2803291160_3	Our results show that 12 out of the 35 videos in our data set focused on conspiracy theories, but no statistical differences were found in the number of user activity and sentiment between the two types of videos.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2803291160	G07.2_2803291160_4	The content of the user responses shows that users respond differently to sub-topics related to Zika-virus.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2883309640	G07.2_2883309640_1	Abstract The present study investigates the characteristics of discussion of conspiracy theories about the Zika virus outbreak of 2015–16 on Twitter.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2883309640	G07.2_2883309640_2	Content and social network analysis of a dataset of 25,162 original Tweets about Zika virus conspiracy theories showed that relative to debunking messages, conspiracy theories spread through a more decentralized network, are more likely to invoke supposedly knowledgeable authorities in making arguments, and ask more rhetorical questions.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2898510718	G07.2_2898510718_1	YouTube, since its inception in 2005, has grown to become largest online video sharing website.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2898510718	G07.2_2898510718_2	Itu0027s massive userbase uploads videos and generates discussion by commenting on these videos.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2898510718	G07.2_2898510718_3	Lately, YouTube, akin to other social media sites, has become a vehicle for spreading fake news, propaganda, conspiracy theories, and radicalizing content.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2898510718	G07.2_2898510718_4	However, lack ineffective image and video processing techniques has hindered research on YouTube.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2898510718	G07.2_2898510718_5	In this paper, we advocate the use of metadata in identifying such malicious behaviors.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2898510718	G07.2_2898510718_6	Specifically, we analyze metadata of videos (e.g., comments, commenters) to study a channel on YouTube that was pushing content promoting conspiracy theories regarding World War III.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2898510718	G07.2_2898510718_7	Identifying signals that could be used to detect such deviant content (e.g., videos, comments) can help in stemming the spread of disinformation.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2898510718	G07.2_2898510718_8	We collected over 4,145 videos along with 16,493 comments from YouTube.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2898510718	G07.2_2898510718_9	We analyze user engagement to assess the reach of the channel and apply social network analysis techniques to identify inorganic behaviors.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2945924652	G07.2_2945924652_1	Increased polarization and partisanship have become a consistent state of politics, media, and society, especially in the United States.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2945924652	G07.2_2945924652_2	As many news publishers are perceived as “biased” and some others have come under attack as being “fake news”, efforts to make such labels stick have increased too.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2945924652	G07.2_2945924652_3	In some cases (e.g., InfoWars), the use of such labels is legitimate, because some online publishers deliberately spread conspiracy theories and false stories.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2945924652	G07.2_2945924652_4	Other news publishers are perceived as partisan and biased, in ways that damages their reporting credibility.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2945924652	G07.2_2945924652_5	Whether political bias affects journalism standards appears to be a debated topic with no clear consensus.
G07.2	conspiracy theories	2945924652	G07.2_2945924652_6	Meanwhile, labels such as “far-left” or “alt-right” are highly contested and may become cause for prolonged edit wars on the Wikipedia pages of some news sources.
T13.1	fairness	1509882388	T13.1_1509882388_1	Fairness is an important concept in design and implementation of distributed systems.
T13.1	fairness	1509882388	T13.1_1509882388_2	At the specification level, fairness usually serves as an assumption for proving liveness.
T13.1	fairness	2118327397	T13.1_2118327397_9	Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is successful in ensuring global fairness in the bridged network.
T13.1	fairness	2139304285	T13.1_2139304285_2	Several fairness index measurements have been proposed in the technical literature.
T13.1	fairness	2139304285	T13.1_2139304285_4	Instantaneous fairness property has not been captured.
T13.1	fairness	2296143973	T13.1_2296143973_3	In this paper, we explore the proportional fairness and the time fairness.
T13.1	fairness	2296143973	T13.1_2296143973_7	Next, we show that the time fairness is a special case of weighted max---min fairness with the weight for a node is equal to its transmission rate.
T13.1	fairness	2296143973	T13.1_2296143973_8	Thus, the existing algorithms to achieve weighted max---min fairness can be used to achieve time fairness as well.
T13.1	fairness	2899682787	T13.1_2899682787_1	Fairness and efficiency are generally two important metrics for users in modern cloud computing.
T13.1	fairness	2899682787	T13.1_2899682787_12	The results show that QKnober can achieve good performance and fairness.
T13.1	fairness	2899682787	T13.1_2899682787_3	Quantitatively showing the fairness degradation/loss becomes essentially important in the design of any fairness-efficiency tradeoff scheduler.
T13.1	fairness	2899682787	T13.1_2899682787_6	First, it cannot quantitatively tell how much relaxed fairness can be guaranteed (i.e., QoS of fairness guarantee) given a knob value.
T13.1	fairness	2899682787	T13.1_2899682787_7	Second, it fails to meet several essential properties such as sharing incentive.
T13.1	fairness	8324080	T13.1_8324080_1	Recent research has found that fairness plays a key role in customer satisfaction.
T13.1	fairness	8324080	T13.1_8324080_2	Fairness in an online context and how it influences customer satisfaction, however, has yet been investigated.
T13.1	fairness	8324080	T13.1_8324080_3	This research examines satisfaction from a fairness lens and explores the mediators of fairness to satisfaction in the internet bank context.
T13.1	fairness	8324080	T13.1_8324080_4	131 surveys were analyzed and results show that in internet bank, fairness that includes distributive fairness, procedural fairness and informational fairness is positively related to customer satisfaction.
T13.1	fairness	8324080	T13.1_8324080_5	Trust and value are identified as two key mediators of fairness to customer satisfaction.
