G11.1_2892036907_1	Current academic and industrial research is interested in autonomous vehicles.
G11.1_2892036907_2	Drones are increasingly used in the civilian and commercial domain and need to be autonomous.
G11.1_2892036907_3	Governments set guidelines on the operation ceiling of civil drones. So, road-tracking based navigation is attracting interest.
G11.1_2892036907_4	Researchers propose data-driven solutions allowing drones to autonomously navigate city streets, learning to fly by imitating an expert pilot.
G11.1_2892036907_5	The algorithm, based on the Inception model, detects roads using tomographic reconstructions. The Inception model is an extension of classic image classification algorithms.
G11.1_2892036907_6	The Inception-v3 architecture has better accuracy than many existing models of imitation learning.
G11.1_2892036907_7	The data used for training the system was captured from the drone over urban streets, navigated by an expert pilot.
G11.1_2892036907_8	Data collection requires special permission to ensure pedestrian security.
G11.1_2892036907_9	The drone can navigate successfully through roads without crashing or overshooting; its accuracy is 98.44%.
G11.1_2892036907_10	MAVNet computational efficiency enables the drone to fly up to 6m/sec.
G11.1_2892036907_11	The solution is compared with other recent methods.
G06.2_2889433965_1	If intelligent systems recognize traffic signs, it can reduce car accidents.
G06.2_2889433965_2	For self-driving cars, we need automatic recognition of traffic and hand signs.
G06.2_2889433965_3	Machine learning techniques  could be used to classify traffic signs.
G06.2_2889433965_4	They perform well on a particular dataset, but fail on multiple traffic sign recognition test datasets.
G06.2_2889433965_5	We proposed a new and better method.
G06.2_2889433965_6	This model is based on enhanced convolutional neural networks (a deep-learning approach often used for image recognition).
G06.2_2889433965_7	This model was more than 99% correct on German and Belgian sign recognition datasets.
G06.2_2889433965_8	This new model is very low in both memory and computational complexity.
G06.2_2810968146_1	Ignition is a neural network for training unconstrained self-driving vehicles in simulated environments.
G06.2_2810968146_2	This ResNet-18 variant model receives images from the front of a simulated car and uses them to steer, throttle, or brake appropriately.
G06.2_2810968146_3	The model is not explicitly trained to detect road features such as track outline or distance to other cars, as these features can automatically be calculated by the network.
G06.2_2890116921_1	A transfer learning method to control self-driving cars is proposed, in which a convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained on one domain then used for the same task in a different domain.
G06.2_2890116921_2	A conventional CNN is designed to map a single front-facing camera image to control a car.
G06.2_2890116921_3	CNN produces a steering command and a lane departure level (LDL, mechanism designed to warn the driver when the vehicle begins to move out of its lane). To enable the transfer learning, a new task module takes the output of the last convolutional layer as input.
G06.2_2890116921_4	The CNN trained on the source domain is then used to train the target network. It takes the output of the last convolutional layer of the source network and is trained to produce a steering command for the target domain.
G06.2_2890116921_5	The steering commands from the source and target network are merged and used for car control in the target domain.
G06.2_2890116921_6	Two simulators were used to evaluate the proposed method.
G06.2_2890116921_7	The proposed method is more stable and safer for car control.
G06.2_2805209921_1	Limited data available for training affects the use of deep learning techniques.
G06.2_2805209921_2	Datasets are available for problems such as item recognition and classification for self-driving cars, but very limited for industrial robotics.
G06.2_2805209921_3	A multi-objective Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was first trained to identify the robot in the image and find 3D positions of the joints using just a 2D image. But this only used robots made by Universal Robots (UR).
G06.2_2805209921_4	Here we work with a new robot arm - Kuka LBR iiwa which looks very different and has an additional joint.
G06.2_2805209921_5	We collect a number of smaller datasets and use transfer learning techniques on the CNN trained on UR robots to adapt it to a robot that looks different.
G06.2_2805209921_6	Transfer learning requires smaller training datasets, learns faster and reaches similar or even better accuracy.
G06.2_2897082611_1	Moral responsibility is a major concern in automated decision-making, from self-driving cars to kidney transplants.
G06.2_855132903_1	Queueing models are used for autonomous mobility-on-demand MOD systems. A queueing model is constructed so that queue lengths and waiting time can be predicted. In MOD systems,  robotic, self-driving vehicles transport customers within an urban environment and rebalance themselves to ensure quality of service.
G06.2_855132903_2	We first cast an autonomous MOD system within a closed Jackson network model,a class of queueing network, with passenger loss.
G06.2_855132903_3	A real-time rebalancing algorithm is applied to a case study of New York City. It is implemented on an eight-vehicle mobile robot testbed.
G06.2_855132903_4	The current taxi demand in Manhattan can be met with about 8,000 robotic vehicles. It represents roughly 70% of the size of the current taxi fleet in Manhattan.
G06.2_855132903_5	Congestion effects are also included to study the impact of autonomously rebalancing vehicles on overall traffic jams.
G06.2_855132903_6	This paper describes the sustainability benefits of robotic transportation networks.
G06.2_602340265_1	The on-going digital revolution will dramatically transform our economy and societal institutions.
G06.2_602340265_2	But this also presents risks for our society.
G06.2_602340265_3	Automation of society is coming.
G06.2_602340265_4	We must choose either between a society in which the actions are determined top-down by coercion or manipulative technologies (such as personalized ads) or in which decisions are taken freely and cooperatively.
G06.2_602340265_5	Modern information and communication systems (ICT) enable both, but the latter has economic and strategic benefits.
G06.2_602340265_6	Foundations of human dignity, autonomous decision-making, and democracies are weakening. These core principles of society and the basis of greater efficiency and success need to be defended.
G06.2_2895666646_1	Once self-driving cars become reality and passengers no longer worry about it, they will need to find other forms of entertainment.
G06.2_2895666646_2	However, high communication delay can slow retrieval of entertainment content from Data Centers (DC).
G06.2_2895666646_3	Self-driving cars can use deep learning caching to address these challenges. It is deployed on the Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) structure that moves services from a centralized cloud to the network edges and closer to the customer.
G06.2_2895666646_4	Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), a type of artificial neural network, is used to predict the content requested in specific areas.
G06.2_2895666646_5	To reduce delay, MLP outputs are sent to MEC servers for roadside units.
G06.2_2895666646_6	A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to predict passengers’ age and gender to cache adapted entertainment content.
G06.2_2895666646_7	The self-driving car can therefore identify the contents to be downloaded and cached.
G06.2_2895666646_8	Deep learning caching is formulated for the self-driving car to enhance entertainment services and minimize content downloading delay.
G06.2_2895666646_9	A Block Successive Majorization-Minimization (BS-MM) technique solves the problem.
G06.2_2895666646_10	Prediction accuracy was 98.04% for contents to be cached for self-driving cars. Such an approach can minimize delay.
G06.2_2891558151_1	This paper describes the Bristol Stock Exchange (BSE), a minimal simulation of a centralised financial market based on a Limit Order Book (LOB), a type of order to buy or sell a security at a specific price or better.
G06.2_2891558151_2	BSE was built because most of the financial markets became automated.
G06.2_2891558151_3	Research tries to understand the dynamics of this automated financial markets but
G06.2_2891558151_4	Trainee engineers also need a realistic learning experience to build automated trading systems.
G06.2_2891558151_5	BSE has been successfully used for both teaching and research since 2012. BSE code is freely available on GitHuB.
G06.2_2801562232_1	This paper studies how stock prices vary with financial disclosures.
G06.2_2801562232_2	We particularly study the many uncategorized filings.
G06.2_2801562232_3	We use latent Dirichlet allocation for topic modeling.
G06.2_2801562232_4	This helps automatically predict the categories based on the content of 70,000 regulatory 8-K filings from U.S. companies, which announce significant events relevant to shareholders.
G06.2_2801562232_5	We then evaluate the stock market reaction.
G06.2_2801562232_6	Evidence suggests a large difference among types of news stories in relevance and impact on financial markets.
G06.2_2801562232_7	For example, we find unusual returns in response to disclosures about earnings results, credit rating, business strategy, the health sector, mergers and acquisitions.
G06.2_2801562232_8	Our results are useful for managers, investors and policy-makers. They show how to structure regulatory filings and which topics influence stock valuations.
G06.2_835365303_1	This paper addresses problems of trading systems in banking.
G06.2_835365303_2	Modern computing allows cross-regional trading transactions within milliseconds.
G06.2_835365303_3	We then discuss how a trading system fits in with the bank ecosystem.
G06.2_2888477402_1	Internal noise generated by motors, fans and mechanical components severely decreases speech recognition accuracy, when the humanoid robot is moving or shaking its body.
G06.2_2888477402_2	This paper presents a novel speech recognition system robust to ego-noise for humanoid robots. On/off state of the motor is used to find relevant input features.
G06.2_2888477402_3	Bottleneck features have been successfully applied to automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems based on deep neural networks (DNN).
G06.2_2888477402_4	The motor on/off state data and acoustic features are used as the input of the first deep neural network (DNN) for preliminary acoustic modeling.
G06.2_2888477402_5	The second DNN for primary acoustic modeling uses both bottleneck features from the first DNN and acoustic ones.
G06.2_2888477402_6	The proposed method is evaluated in terms of phoneme error rate (PER) on TIMIT database, experimental results show that improvement (11% relative) is achieved by our algorithm over the conventional systems.
G06.2_89451762_1	Model based techniques exist to apply domestic service tasks on humanoid robots, such as teleoperation, learning from demonstration and imitation.
G06.2_89451762_2	Sensor based robot control overcomes difficulties of uncertain models and unknown environments.
G06.2_89451762_3	Interaction between the robot and its environment using the sensor based control is important.
G07.1_2888100547_1	Social media give users opportunities to interact with different opinions.
G07.1_2888100547_2	But misinformation is spread via social media because individuals can search for information that confirms their beliefs and personalized news algorithms may supply it.
G07.1_2888100547_3	Theoretical understanding of the balance between opportunities and misinformation is incomplete.
G07.1_2888100547_4	We introduce a stylized social learning model. In this model, most participants in a network update their beliefs based on new information, while others show confirmation bias and can reject news that differs from their beliefs.
G07.1_2888100547_5	This simple confirmation bias mechanism can create lasting opinion polarisation.
G07.1_2888100547_6	Besides, in the model, unbiased people behave “as if” biased because biased neighbours limit their access to diverse information.
G07.1_2888100547_7	With our model, we show the trade-off between confirmation bias and social connectivity. We validated the model using the data on how internet access influences beliefs on global warming.
G07.1_2888100547_8	Small confirmation bias may even improve accuracy across individuals by keeping information diversity in a social network.
G07.1_2888100547_9	But large confirmation bias lowers accuracy as biased individuals limit information flow to others.
G07.1_2888100547_10	We discuss the meaning of our model for policy and the downsides of myth-busting We suggest alternatives to fight misinformation.
G07.1_2803622358_1	The WWW changed the ways we can produce and access information.
G07.1_2803622358_2	Users tend to select information that agrees with their beliefs. They form polarized groups of like-minded people sharing narratives that ignore contradicting information.
G07.1_2803622358_3	Here, users reinforce their shared narratives and can resist debunking
G07.1_2803622358_4	This is the case with online news. Because 63% of users access news from social media, polarization could increase misinfomation spread.
G07.1_2803622358_5	We focus on polarisation of Facebook news consumers in different European countries.
G07.1_2803622358_6	Posting, liking and commenting rates differ across countries.
G07.1_2803622358_7	We look at how users interact with different pages and polarized communities form around specific pages.
G07.1_2803622367_1	Italy is the most polarized country, then France, Germany and Spain.
G07.1_2803622367_2	A variant of the Bounded Confidence Model simulates the emergence of these communities by considering user engagement and trust in the news.
G07.1_2803622367_3	Trust in an information source plays a major role against polarization of users online.
G08.1_2898599358_1	In decentralised P2P networks nodes need a way  to control resource usage and prevent flooding and denial-of-service attacks.
G08.1_2898599358_2	We compared different approaches to decentralised resource control in cryptocurrency projects.
G08.1_2898599358_3	We designed a decentralised exchange for crypto assets, for  example Namecoin names, with these methods.
G08.1_2889349357_1	Memory-bound cryptocurrencies like Monero can be mined  from a browser with JavaScript, better than with a dedicated rig.
G08.1_2889349357_2	However, this technology enables cryptojacking, whereby a site covertly mines for cryptocurrencies on its visitors’ computers.
G08.1_2889349357_3	We propose a new approach to identify mining scripts. The approach was evaluated on Alexa 1 websites.
G08.1_2889349357_4	Cryptojacking is common, as 1 in 500 sites host a mining script.
G08.1_2889349357_5	We also measured code characteristics, estimated mining revenue, and evaluated blacklist-based countermeasures.
G08.1_2889740224_1	Smart contracts have appeared thanks to blockchain technology.
G08.1_2889740224_2	These autonomous programs are used in law, business, commerce, and governance. Smart contracts are written in a high-level language such as Ethereum’s Solidity and translated to bytecode. that live and run on the blockchain are predicted in
G08.1_2889740224_3	Once deployed on the blockchain, the bytecode is autonomous.
G08.1_2889740224_4	Smart contracts are vulnerable to malicious attacks due to poor programming, languages and toolchains
G08.1_2889740224_5	Smart contracts can command large amounts of cryptocurrency.
G08.1_2889740224_6	Developers and auditors need frameworks to detect security vulnerabilities.
G08.1_2889740224_7	Vandal is a security analysis framework for Ethereum smart contracts.
G08.1_2889740224_8	Vandal converts Ethereum Virtual Machine bytecode to semantic logic relations.
G08.1_2889740224_9	Users can express security analyses in the Soufflé language.
G08.1_2889740235_1	Vandal is both efficient (95% accuracy), fast (141k in 4.15 s) and robust. It outperforms the state of the art tools like Oyente, EthIR, Mythril, and Rattle
G08.1_2895247503_1	One of the most powerful potential adversaries is the country of China, which has expressed adversarial positions regarding the cryptocurrency and demonstrated powerful capabilities to influence it.
G09.1_754200012_1	Image tampering has become a serious problem with the advancement of digital techniques.
G09.1_754200012_2	JPEG images can be easily manipulated without leaving any clues. This is why researchers are trying to develop methods for JPEG image manipulation detection.
G09.1_754200012_3	However, methods based on image compression techniques, like quantization, are rarely applied.
G09.1_754200012_4	To detect such manipulations, we propose a detection method to identify inconsistencies in the quantization matrix caused by the manipulation.
G09.1_754200012_5	Then machine learning algorithms are applied to detect image manipulation.
G09.1_754200012_6	Experimental results show that the approach is highly effective in detecting image tampering.
G09.1_567125047_1	Machine timestamp falsification can be used in cyber attacks.
G09.1_567125047_2	That is why it is important to detect such changes and to reconstruct the actual timeline of events.
G09.1_567125047_3	However, the hacker can try to hide their tracks.
G09.1_567125047_4	In cloud computing, hackers can manipulate host and guest machine time.
G09.1_567125047_5	Guest virtual machines use computing resources provided by a physical machine called a host. Guest virtual machines are especially vulnerable to attacks coming from their host.
G09.1_567125047_6	That is why the timeline integrity of both hosts and guests in a cloud is important. Any manipulation of such a timeline should be detected.
G09.1_567125047_7	In this paper we survey the issues related to host and guest machine time integrity in the cloud.
G09.1_567125047_8	A new algorithm is proposed to detect host and guest time manipulations and to correct or reject them.
G09.1_567125047_9	A simulator has been built for this purpose.
G09.1_567125047_10	The algorithm detects manipulations effectively.
G09.1_2885025643_1	Detection of image editing is an important task in image forensics.
G09.1_2885025643_2	The edit history of an image can expose forgeries in the image.
G09.1_2885025643_3	Various methods have been proposed to detect image editing operations.
G09.1_2885025643_4	However all of the possible types of image manipulation must be known in advance.
G09.1_2885025643_5	But, in the real world, manipulations on images are sometimes unknowable.
G09.1_2885025643_6	A novel deep learning-based method can distinguish between different types of image editing operations.
G09.1_2885025643_7	This method uses a deep siamese neural network to compare images two by two.
G09.1_2885025643_8	Using deep learning, the computer can learn to see features of edited images as compared to unedited and learn to differentiate between different image editing operations.
G09.1_2885025643_9	This method works to find out what editing an image has undergone.
G01.1_2797641221_1	Digital assistants are becoming popular in our daily lives. It will allow users to do multiple tasks in a faster way.
G01.1_2463945949_1	DIANE is a digital assistant system that allows the doctor a faster access patient and hospital information. This could be done with face recognition and live streaming.
G01.2_1448624402_1	Research showed that people suffer from diverse biases (disproportionate weight in favor of or against an idea) in decision-making.
G01.2_1448624402_2	We analyzed the effects of decision-making biases of managers on organizational performance.
G01.2_1448624402_3	In the simulations, managers decisions which are based on organizational skills and rules, suffer from several known biases.
G01.2_1448624402_4	The results illustrate how combined biases in different contexts affect organizational performance.
G01.2_1448624402_5	Contrary to expectations, some combinations of biases improve organizational performance. However, when they occur separately, they decrease performance.
G01.2_1448624402_6	This raises questions about the importance of rationality in decision-making.
G10.1_2968701259_1	Perception of the environment is necessary for mobile robots to navigate safely in dynamic environments.
G10.1_2968701259_2	Most robots (humanoids and wheeled robots) rely on planar regions.
G10.1_2968701259_3	For humanoids (robots with human form or characteristics), a 2D map is not sufficient because they can step over and onto objects, so they need height information.
G10.1_2968701259_4	Dynamic obstacles bring another level of complexity, because it can lead to necessary replanning or collisions.
G10.1_2968701259_5	In this paper, we present a framework that extracts planar regions in height maps and detects dynamic obstacles.
G10.1_2968701259_6	Our system then uses this information to create a set of prediction maps, in which paths can be planned in real time at low processor cost.
G10.1_2968701259_7	We show in simulation and real-world experiments that our framework keeps run times well under 10ms and allows for real-time 3D footstep planning.
G10.1_2906808597_1	An autonomous service robot often first has to search for a user to execute a task.
G10.1_2906808597_2	This is a challenging problem, especially when this person moves around because the robot’s field of view is limited. The environment also poses visibility limitations that influence the perception of the user.
G10.1_2906808597_3	In this paper, we propose a method that estimate the user’s observability in the environment.
G10.1_2906808597_4	When estimating effective search locations, we take into account the time for the robot to reach the search location and the visibility limitations.
G10.1_2906808597_5	In this way, the robot can choose the next search location that has the maximum expected observability of the user.
G10.1_2906808597_6	Our experiments demonstrate that our approach leads to a significantly shorter search time compared to other approach.
G10.1_2773777794_1	In many situations, users walk on typical paths between specific destinations at which the service of a mobile robot is needed.
G10.1_2773777794_2	Depending on the environment and the paths, following the human might not be the optimal solution because better paths for the robot exist.
G10.1_2773777794_3	We propose to predict the human’s future movements and use this information to generate navigation actions for the robot.
G10.1_2773777794_4	The estimation of the human’s position and the prediction of the next destination are uncertain because of the occlusions due to obstacles and the robot’s limited field of view.
G10.1_2773777794_5	Our approach deals with considering occlusions so the robot automatically considers to execute actions to get the human in its field of view.
G10.1_2773777794_6	We show that our technique leads to significantly shorter paths compared to an approach in which the robot follows the user and, additionally, can handle occlusions.
G10.1_2562908749_1	In this paper, we introduce an approach for robot to navigate through cluttered indoor environments.
G10.1_2562908749_2	We propose to estimate obstacles based on already detected objects and use them to predict potential obstacles in regions not yet observable by the robot.
G10.1_2562908749_3	The robot is then able to navigate in a more anticipated manner and reduces the risk of getting stuck.
G10.1_2562908749_4	Our method enables the robot to efficiently navigate through cluttered environments and faster than a standard approach not using any prediction.
G10.1_2093013061_1	In this paper, we present a navigation system that allows humanoid robots (robots with human form or characteristics) to autonomously navigate in unknown, cluttered environments.
G10.1_2093013061_2	From the data of a camera which can judge depth and distance, our system estimates the robot’s position and maintains a height representation of the environment.
G10.1_2093013061_3	Our system determines safe actions (including footsteps and body motions) leading the robot to target locations.
G10.1_2093013061_4	To efficiently check for collisions during planning, we developed a new approach that takes into account the shape of the robot and the obstacles.
G10.1_2093013061_5	As we demonstrate in experiments, our system allows the robot to navigate in clustered environments and traverse challenging passages.
G10.1_1593729956_1	In this paper, we present a novel approach to accurately calibrate a humanoid and its motions (robot with human form or characteristics) based on observations of its camera.
G10.1_1593729956_2	Our technique estimates the parameters of the complete model, consisting of the joint angle offsets and the camera parameters.
G10.1_1593729956_3	We developed an approach to automatically select configurations for the calibration process that produces a good compromise between the number of observations and accuracy.
G10.1_1593729956_4	Our approach to configuration selection generates better optimization results compared to randomly chosen viable configurations.
G10.1_1593729956_5	Thus, our system only requires a reduced number of configurations to achieve accurate results.
G10.1_1593729956_6	Our optimization is general and the implementation, which is available online, can easily be applied to different humanoids.
G11.1_2794850674_1	In this paper, a concept of lab automation drone is introduced.
G11.1_2794850674_2	Here, a robotic arm is attached to a drone.
G11.1_2794850674_3	The arm’s gripper allows the drone to manipulate objects such as chips and test tubes often used in scientific experimentations like high throughput systems.
G11.1_2794850674_4	The drone could augment existing high throughput systems operations.

G13.1_3004169763_2	More business activities have been engaged in the digital world.
G13.1_3004169763_3	Marketing and advertising is one of typical business areas that is transformed digitally.
G13.1_3004169763_4	Many businesses consider the adoption of digital marketing tools for their promotion and advertisement, due to the rise of Key Opinion Leaders (person with expert status and influence), social media platforms, and Omni-channel retailing (multiple channels but a uniform experience for the customer).
G13.1_3004169763_5	However, with the increasing diversity of digital marketing tools, they must be carefully selected.
G13.1_3004169763_6	In this paper, a method to organize and analyze complex decisions is proposed and developed for assisting businesses to evaluate and select appropriate digital marketing tools.
G13.1_3004169763_7	The developed method rationalizes and simplifies the process of digital marketing tool selection. It also increases effectiveness of achieving strategic marketing objectives.

G13.1_2570453702_3	The study provides new insights from tourism studies on digital marketing.
G13.1_2570453702_4	Findings show that digital marketing capabilities of companies are transformed by ICT tools.
G13.1_2570453702_5	Four major capabilities were identified, each of which evolves as a result of using the tools.
G13.1_2570453702_6	A key finding of the study is that ICT tools transform these capabilities in a set of abilities for SMEs in web-marketing.
G02.2_2134216589_1	Big data (the ability to collect, store and analyze huge quantities of data in a really fast and cheap way) offers immense benefits in marketing, healthcare, environment, national security and more.
G02.2_2134216589_2	The principles of privacy, limitation of data collection and use are stretched by the business and technological reality of big data.
G02.2_2134216589_3	Our increasing interactions with these technologies without human supervision, and their growing autonomy, functionality and behavior raises legal and philosophical questions.
G02.2_2134216589_4	The focus on the machine is a distraction from the debate on ethical dilemmas about data like privacy, fairness and discrimination.
G02.2_2134216589_5	The machine may influence the ethical challenges, but the humans must remain responsible.
G02.2_2134216589_6	Responsible people should find guidelines for ethical data analysis and collection.
G02.2_2134216589_7	These guidelines would deal with mechanisms to protect data, criteria about unethical or illegal behavior, privacy harms, and strategies to give people access to data.
G03.1_2960901639_1	Smart speakers are becoming popular around the world and people will get used to this new way of interacting with the voice.
G03.1_2960901639_2	Even with the progress of speech recognition and natural language processing (interactions between computers and human language), users may still get errors like “cannot understand” or “no requested audio resource” which can frustrate users.
G03.1_2960901639_3	So, it is important that the smart speaker gives an effective and proper response during an error message.
G03.1_2960901639_4	The responses of the most popular brand of smart speakers are based on 2 elements, apology and humor.
G03.1_2960901639_5	We studied user’s preference in two error scenarios : “cannot understand” and “no requested resource”
G03.1_2960901639_6	Satisfaction of the user and perceived sincerity of the response were measured.
G03.1_2960901639_7	The results showed that users were more satisfied and perceived higher sincerity when smart speaker apologized in both error scenarios.
G03.1_2960901639_8	In the “no requested audio resource” scenario, humor had no impact on the satisfaction or sincerity.
G03.1_2960901639_9	But in the “cannot understand” scenario, humor decreased perceived sincerity.
G03.1_2949291273_1	The smart speakers cannot differentiate between human voice and machine voice.
G03.1_2949291273_2	A method to identify if the voice command is from a human or a machine is required.
G03.1_2949291273_3	We propose a system composed of a speaker and microphones to detect the presence of humans. It could help to prevent attacks on a smart speaker with a machine voice in absence of residents
G03.1_2943753439_1	The VUIs (voice user interface) like Amazon’s Echo or Apple’s Siri are popular nowadays. However, they have limited language options for users.
G03.1_2943753439_2	We studied the usability of the Google Home Smart Speaker with native and non-native English speakers to understand their differences in using this device.
G03.1_2943753439_3	The results show that the native English speakers had a better experience with the device than the non-native.
G03.1_2943753439_4	It also shows that language skills play an important role.
G03.1_2943753439_5	The results of this study can help VUI developers for improving language options and voice recognition in the devices.
G04.1_2214798411_1	A pharmacophore analysis investigated and compared different compounds of the drug discovery process.
G04.1_2214798411_2	Significant differences were observed between the pharmacophore profiles of the drug molecules and the high-throughput screening compounds, which appear to be related to the nondrug pharmacophore distribution.
G04.1_2214798411_3	It is suggested that the analysis could be used as an additional tool for the optimization of compound selection and library design processes..
G04.1_2339209416_1	Annotation of bioassay protocols with web vocabulary can make experiment descriptions machine-readable.
G04.1_2339209416_2	Protocols use concise scientific English which prevents most of analysis by software algorithms.
G04.1_2339209416_3	There is a sufficient ontology, so the pertinent information can be written using semantic web triples (subject, predicate, object).
G04.1_2339209416_4	With appropriate annotation, assays can be searched, clustered, tagged and evaluated.
G04.1_2339209416_5	The BioAssay Ontology (BAO) has been designed for this purpose, and provides many meaningful terms.
G04.2_2415325177_1	Next generation sequencing (NGS) produces datasets of billions of reads and thousands of samples.
G04.2_2415325177_2	The analysis is typically done with open source tools, performing a single step towards the final result.
G04.2_2415325177_3	The bioinformaticians have to combine the tools, manage the files and information, document the analysis, and ensure reproducibility.
G04.3_2040043577_1	SPSS Clementinel2.0 statistical software was used to extract data and find relations between traditional Chinese medicine and other medicine.

G04.3_2941964798_1	Identifying bacterias that are resistant to antimicrobial in samples of genetic material collected from the environment is essential for public health and food safety.
G04.3_2941964798_2	Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has provided a powerful tool in identifying the genetic variation and constructing the correlations between genotype (genetic code of an individual) and phenotype (physical characteristics of an indvidual) in humans and other species.
G04.3_2941964798_3	The Genetic Polymorphism Assignements (GPA) is a framework which determines the genetic constitution of multiple bacteria while reducing the number of false positive results and improving the accuracy of calculations when identifying the variation of a single nucleotide.
G05.1_2757079914_1	CRISPR-Cas is a tool used for gene editing.
G05.1_2757079914_2	However, unintended genetic modifications may occur.
G05.1_2757079914_3	Anti-CRISPR proteins (molecules that inhibit the CRISPR-Cas system) may improve utilization of the CRISPR-Cas system in gene editing, especially for gene therapy.
G05.1_2757079914_4	More research on these proteins would help to understand the co-evolution of bacteria and bacteriophages (virus that infects and replicates within bacteria).
G05.1_2757079914_5	It is necessary to collect and integrate data on various types of anti-CRISPRs.
G05.1_2117924928_1	The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a powerful technology for gene editing and gene regulation.
G05.1_2117924928_2	These applications require the design of single guide RNAs (which are enzymes that can delete, insert or alter DNA) that are efficient and specific.
G05.1_2117924928_3	However, this remains challenging, as it requires the consideration of many criteria.
G05.1_2914002216_1	CRISPR is a popular research area known for its efficiency and specificity in editing DNA sequences.
G05.1_2914002216_2	A variety of gene editing techniques have been developed for different aims.
G05.1_2914002216_3	The target locations of a DNA strain can be precisely broken and repaired, during which the genes can be removed, repaired, silenced, or activated.
G05.1_2914002216_4	The high efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9 reagents preparation and the easiness of experiment conduction make it a powerful tool.
G05.1_2584932255_1	Gene editing could be used to solve issues related to health care allocation.
G05.1_2584932255_2	Improving the health of future generations might coincide with public health goals.
G05.1_2584932255_3	However, enhancing future generations will require In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) and Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis.
G05.1_2584932255_4	The necessary involvement of women in an enhancing scenario has not been discussed.
G05.1_2584932255_5	The discourse on moral obligations of future generations seems to imply that women might be required to reproduce with IVF.
G05.1_2584932255_6	Enhancing future generations will be gendered, unless the artificial womb is developed.
G05.1_2584932255_7	These are challenging issues that require a wider perspective, of both women and men.
G05.1_2584932255_8	There are no unified feminist conclusion about the merits and risks of human genome modification. There is also an urgent need to clarify the role of women in this scenario.
G05.2_2796443924_1	The CRISPR-Cpf1 system (a DNA-editing technology) has been successfully applied in gene editing.
G05.2_2796443924_2	However target efficiency of the CRISPR-Cpf1 system varies among different gRNA (piece of RNA that serves as a guide to DNA-targeting enzymes) sequences.
G05.2_2796443924_3	Using machine learning technology, a support-vector machine model (algorithm used for data classification) was created to predict the target efficiency for any given gRNAs.
G05.2_2796443924_4	CRISPR-DT (CRISPR DNA Targeting) is available. It is the first web service application to help users design optimal gRNAs for the CRISPR-Cpf1 system by considering both target efficiency and target specificity (recognition mecanism).
G06.2_2906897310_1	A key problem for autonomous car navigation is the understanding of the environment while driving.
G06.2_2906897310_2	It needs to extract information from the sensors and cameras and classify the elements into categories so it can be easily analysed (streets, buildings, pedestrians, vehicles, signs, etc.).
G06.2_2906897310_3	A method is to fuse 3D map data with classification of the sensors and cameras.
G06.2_2906897310_4	This system combine image segmentation (simplify the representation of an image to facilitate its analysis) and information obtained from sensors and cameras while integrating prior information.
G06.2_2906897310_5	This approach was tested on manually entered data in urban environments.
G06.2_2906897310_6	The results show that the classification of elements is more accurate with this method than the image segmentation alone.
G06.2_2968176166_1	Self-driving vehicles have become common on public roads, with the promise of a safe and efficient mode of transport.
G06.2_2968176166_2	To be reliable, these vehicles need many software tests on simulators with interactions of multiple vehicles and pedestrians.
G06.2_2968176166_3	It is essential that self-driving software is evaluated with many different challenging driving scenarios.
G06.2_2968176166_4	The driving scenario generation still needs human contribution.
G06.2_2968176166_5	We propose to automate the process and generate conflicting self-driving that expose weaknesses of self-driving policies, and increase the risk of collision with simulated pedestrians and vehicles.
G06.2_2968176166_6	By incorporating the generated scenarios into the parameters of the self-driving policy, and by adjusting the policy with the imitation learning, we obtain safer self-driving behavior.
G06.2_2958092349_1	Self-driving technology is developing, more and more driverless vehicles are launched in market and accessible for people in their daily life.
G06.2_2958092349_2	So there is a growing demand for the autopilot experience.
G06.2_2958092349_3	Natural and efficient human-computer interaction can improve the driving experience and accelerate the process of self-driving commercialization.
G06.2_2958092349_4	This paper discusses interactions with the eye, voice and gesture in self-driving car, analyzes the technology, the interaction modes, and considers the future of self-driving human-computer interaction.
G06.2_2606555570_1	Self-driving vehicle technologies are progressing and are expected to play a significant role in the future of transportation.
G06.2_2606555570_2	A main challenge for self-driving vehicles on public roads is the safe cooperation, collaboration and communication with other vehicles.
G06.2_2606555570_3	When self-driving vehicles are in the same area, they might collide, become blocked, or suddenly brake and make uncomfortable or unsafe the passengers.
G06.2_2606555570_4	We study how a self-driving vehicle can safely navigate merge points, where two lanes with different priorities meet.
G06.2_2606555570_5	We present a safe protocol where self-driving vehicles use both vehicular communications and their own perception systems for cooperating with other vehicles (self-driving or human-driven).
G06.2_2606555570_6	Our simulation results show that our traffic protocol leads to a better traffic flow, while ensuring safety.
G06.2_2548923997_1	Self-driving vehicles are vulnerable to different attacks because of their communication systems.
G06.2_2548923997_2	These vehicles use external communication via a network.
G06.2_2548923997_3	This network add new threats to self-driving vehicles that contribute to the challenges in autonomous systems.
G06.2_2548923997_4	With these communication systems, self-driving vehicles are vulnerable to many types of malicious attacks on the network.
G06.2_2548923997_5	In this paper, we propose an intelligent security system to secure external communications for self-driving cars.
G06.2_2548923997_6	The system will detect a common type of attack in the network: Denial-of-Service (attack trying to make network resource unavailable).
G06.2_2548923997_7	The results show that the intrusion detection system is capable of identifying malicious vehicles in self-driving vehicles.
G06.2_2931522054_1	This paper proposes MATLAB/Simulink tests for an open-source self-driving system based on Robot Operating System.
G06.2_2931522054_2	One approach to the development of self-driving systems is the utilization of Robot Operating System (open-source software framework used in the development of robot applications).
G06.2_2931522054_3	But the popular approach in the automotive industry is the utilization of MATLAB/Simulink (software for modeling, simulating, and analyzing).
G06.2_2931522054_4	MATLAB/Simulink provides an interface that enables to create functionalities of robots (based on robot operating system).
G06.2_2931522054_5	However, it is not fully utilized in the development of self-driving systems yet because there are not enough samples, and it is difficult for developers to adopt co-development.
G06.2_2931522054_6	We provide MATLAB/Simulink tests for a self-driving system (based on robot operating system) called Autoware.
G06.2_2931522054_7	Autoware is a popular open-source software that provides a complete set of self-driving modules.
G06.2_2931522054_8	The provided tests contain MATLAB/Simulink samples available in Autoware.
G06.2_2931522054_9	They help to design self-driving systems (based on robot operating system) using MATLAB/Simulink.
G06.2_2954032282_1	Ensuring the safety of self-driving cars is important, but there is no standard way to test them.
G06.2_2954032282_2	Testing self-driving cars in regular traffic is costly and risky, and has already caused fatalities.
G06.2_2954032282_3	As a safer alternative, virtual tests (self-driving car software tested in computer simulations) have been proposed.
G06.2_2954032282_4	To cover the huge number of possible driving situations, self-driving cars must be tested in manually created tests.
G06.2_2954032282_5	We developed AsFault, a tool for automatically generating virtual tests for testing self-driving car software.
G06.2_2954032282_6	We demonstrate AsFault by testing the lane keeping feature of a self-driving car software with scenarios going off the road.
G06.2_2954032282_7	A video illustrating AsFault in action is available at: https://youtu.be/lJ1sa42VLDw
G06.2_2982382045_1	Little is known about how potential users perceive self-driving vehicles.
G06.2_2982382045_2	This is especially true for self-driving vehicles in public transport services.
G06.2_2982382045_3	In this study, the preferences between a trip in a self-driving bus and a regular bus were compared.
G06.2_2982382045_4	The results of 282 participants were studied, including trust in self-driving vehicles and interest in technology.
G06.2_2982382045_5	The results show that currently public transport passengers prefer the self-driving bus over the regular bus only for short trips.
G06.2_2982382045_6	The preference is about twice as high for the self-driving bus as for the regular bus for a short commuting trip.
G06.2_2982382045_7	The popularity of self-driving busses decreases with the presence of a human steward on-board, or if they are operated as a demand-responsive service with fixed routes.
G06.2_2982382045_8	People who currently show a strong interest in technology or trust in automated vehicle technology perceive the self-driving busses better than others.
G06.2_2982382045_9	Preferences for automated public transport services are expected to evolve with their deployment in regular operations.
G06.2_2935172463_1	The management of self-driving systems is becoming more complex as the development of self-driving technology progresses.
G06.2_2935172463_2	Self-driving systems use Robot Operating System (open-source software framework used in the development of robot applications). However, in the automotive industry, the system is designed using MATLAB/Simulink, which can simulate and evaluate the models used for self-driving.
G06.2_2935172463_3	These models are incompatible with systems based on Robot Operating System.
G06.2_2935172463_4	To use both, it is necessary to incorporate new code into the system based on Robot Operating System, which makes development inefficient.
G06.2_2935172463_5	Therefore, the proposed framework allows models created using MATLAB/Simulink to be used in a self-driving system, which improve development efficiency.
G06.2_2935172463_6	Furthermore, our evaluations of the proposed framework demonstrated its practical potential.
G07.1_2239526842_1	Social media have become popular means of information sharing.
G07.1_2239526842_2	The spread of news regarding emergency events is common in social media but so is the spread of misinformation.
G07.1_2239526842_3	Misinformation is any false or inaccurate information that is spread intentionally or not.
G07.1_2239526842_4	In this paper we study the problem of misinformation identification in social media, and we focus in particular on Twitter.
G07.1_2239526842_5	We build a misinformation detection model that identifies suspicious behavioral patterns and detect misinformation.
G07.1_2239526842_6	We found 80294 unique tweets and 59660 users. It illustrates that our approach identifies misinformation during emergencies.
G07.1_2239526842_7	Our model manages to timely identify misinformation, it can be used to limit the spread of the misinformation.
G07.1_2894304194_1	Superintelligence is a potential future artificial intelligence (AI) significantly more intelligent than humans.
G07.1_2894304194_2	Superintelligence could be a major event, with potential consequences that are beneficial or catastrophic.
G07.1_2894304194_3	The prospect of superintelligence is the subject of major debate, which includes a lot of misinformation.
G07.1_2894304194_4	Superintelligence misinformation could be dangerous, and lead to bad decisions by the people that could work on the project.
G07.1_2894304194_5	This paper searches for strategies to counter superintelligence misinformation.
G07.1_2894304194_6	Two strategies are examined: to prevent the spread of misinformation and to correct it after it has spread.
G07.1_2894304194_7	Misinformation can be difficult to correct, so preventing it seems to be the best strategy.
G07.1_2894304194_8	The strategies proposed can be used to bring public attention to superintelligence, AI education programs, and efforts to build expert consensus.
G07.1_2950010073_1	The online misinformation could cause public panic and serious economic damages.
G07.1_2950010073_2	The goal of misinformation containment is to limit the spread of misinformation in online social networks by launching campaigns to counter misinformation.
G07.1_2950010073_3	We present the first analysis of the misinformation containment problem with a random number of cascades (people observe the actions of others and then make the same choice) allowed.
G07.1_2950010073_4	First, we provide a diffusion model and introduce an important concept called as cascade priority.
G07.1_2950010073_5	Second, we show that the misinformation containment problem cannot be approximated within a factor of Ω(2log1−ϵn4) in polynomial time unless $NP \subseteq DTIME(n^{\polylog{n}})$
G07.1_2950010073_6	Third, we introduce several types of cascade priority that are frequently seen in social networks.
G07.1_2950010073_7	Finally, we design algorithms for solving the misinformation containment problem.
G07.1_2950010073_8	The proposed algorithm is effective and shows encouraging results.
G07.1_2100028027_1	Inaccurate information is often regarded as a problem that needs to be corrected or simply understood as misinformation or disinformation without further consideration.
G07.1_2100028027_2	Misinformation and disinformation may cause problems online because users are constantly exposed to inaccurate and/or false information.
G07.1_2100028027_3	This paper aims to establish preliminary work for future research by examining the relationships among information, misinformation, and disinformation.
G07.1_2100028027_4	Our analysis extends to a discussion of means for detecting misinformation and disinformation.
G07.1_2100028027_5	We argue that misinformation and disinformation are related but distinct sub-categories of information.
G07.1_2100028027_6	Misinformation is more complex than simply being inaccurate or incomplete, and disinformation does not always involve misinformation.
G07.1_2111507945_1	The growth of social media leads to better communication between people, but also propagation of misinformation.
G07.1_2111507945_2	The wide spread of misinformation over social media have bad consequences for public interest.
G07.1_2111507945_3	We design a framework to help identify misinformation.
G07.1_2111507945_4	The idea is to index the expertise of users and to match the experts with given suspected misinformation.
G07.1_2111507945_5	By sending the suspected misinformation to appropriate experts, they can judge the credibility of information, and help refute misinformation.
G07.1_2111507945_6	In this paper, we focus on finding appropriate experts for misinformation identification.
G07.1_2111507945_7	We propose a method to index the expertise of users with tags.
G07.1_2111507945_8	Experiments on a real world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for expert finding for misinformation identification.
G07.1_2124690797_1	The importance of research on misinformation has received wide recognition.
G07.1_2124690797_2	Two major challenges faced by this research community are the lack of theoretical models and the rare misinformation data.
G07.1_2124690797_3	This paper aims to address these challenges by conceptualizing misinformation and being able to completely understand and work on misinformation.
G07.1_2124690797_4	A representation and a model of misinformation are proposed through existing work in the field.
G07.1_2124690797_5	The model can guide future misinformation research and help building a digital misinformation library by advancing our knowledge on misinformation and by improving its sharing, management, and reuse.
G07.1_2124690797_6	In addition, we present a methodology for managing misinformation in a digital library, and suggest future research directions.
G07.2_2773680786_1	Conspiracy theories have gained much attention recently, due to their large impact on public events.
G07.2_2773680786_2	Little is known about how conspiracy theories are produced and developed on social media.
G07.2_2773680786_3	We present a study of conspiracy theory creation on Reddit during a public health crisis.
G07.2_2773680786_4	Using content and discourse analysis, we identified types of conspiracy theories that appeared on Reddit in response to the crisis, the conditions of their creation, and the strategies of their development in online forums.
G07.2_2773680786_5	Our analysis shows that conspiracy talk come from people trying to make sense of a public health crisis, which reflect their information needs and their lack of confidence in formal sources of information.
G07.2_2773680786_6	Implications for social computing researchers, health practitioners, and policymakers are discussed.
G07.2_2899514909_1	Conspiracy theories are omnipresent in online discussions.
G07.2_2899514909_2	Conspiracy theories evolve, multiply, and interconnect, complicating how to understand them and to limit their propagation.
G07.2_2899514909_3	It is crucial to develop methods to examine the nature of these conspiratorial discussions.
G07.2_2899514909_4	What do users talk about? What are the recurring elements in their discussions? What do these elements tell us about the way users think? This work answers these questions by analyzing over ten years of discussions in an online community on the social media Reddit dedicated to conspiratorial discussions.
G07.2_2899514909_5	We focus on the key elements of a conspiracy theory: the conspiratorial agents, the actions they perform, and their targets.
G07.2_2899514909_6	"For example, a narrative-motif (an idea) such as ""governmental agency-controls-communications"" represents the various ways in which multiple conspiratorial statements suggest how governmental agencies control information."
G07.2_2899514909_7	Narrative-motifs expose similarities between multiple conspiracy theories even when they refer to different events or circumstances.
G07.2_2899514909_8	These representations help us understand how users talk about conspiracy theories and offer us a means to interpret what they talk about.
G07.2_2899514909_9	Our approach enables a population-scale study of conspiracy theories in alternative news and social media and ways to understand them and limit their propagation.
G07.2_2749521565_1	To believe in conspiracy theories is understandable as conspiracies occur and if we take an evidential approach, belief in such theories turns out to be warranted in a range of cases.
G07.2_2749521565_2	Drawing on this work, I examine evidence associated with conspiracy theories, showing that the evidential problems are not unique to conspiracy theories.
G07.2_2749521565_3	The problem with the use of evidence of conspiracy theorist could be the principle which guides their use of it. I argue that there is no ground to be suspicious of conspiracy theories as a whole, because those are based on evidence.
G08.1_2907181942_1	Cryptocurrency is a financial technology innovation which has attracted many people around the world.
G08.1_2907181942_2	The high-speed evolution, radical price fluctuations of cryptocurrency, and the inconsistent attitudes of monetary authorities in different countries have caused panic.
G08.1_2907181942_3	In this paper, we analyze the dynamics and risks of the cryptocurrency market.
G08.1_2907181942_4	Consistent with public perception, our analysis reveals that the cryptocurrency market is fragile and unstable.
G08.1_2806518684_1	Blockchain technology is a technology developed for Bitcoin, the most common cryptocurrency.
G08.1_2806518684_2	Blockchain technologies have become popular with the potential to become a powerful disruptive force.
G08.1_2806518684_3	People and organizations may use it to increase secure data exchange and make transactions simpler and easier.
G08.1_2806518684_4	We investigate what influence people to use a blockchain cryptocurrency.
G08.1_2806518684_5	We develop a model of cryptocurrency adoption to identify how cryptocurrency is accepted.
G08.1_2806518684_6	Our evidence allow a better understanding of cryptocurrency adoption.
G08.1_2972302621_1	Cryptocurrency was initially an implementation of digital currency, then derivatives were created in various fields.
G08.1_2972302621_2	This paper aims to help understand cryptocurrency.
G08.1_2972302621_3	We compared cryptocurrency with foreign exchange and stock.
G08.1_2972302621_4	Our investigation suggests that cryptocurrency is similar to stock.
G08.1_2972302621_5	Our analysis shows that cryptocurrency market is more fragile than stock market, thus it is currently a high-risk financial market.
G08.1_3004077497_1	The owning rate of smart devices is higher than ever before and mobile payment has become a major payment method.
G08.1_3004077497_2	Cryptocurrency is becoming an important type of currency and the total value of cryptocurrencies has reached USD 200 billion.
G08.1_3004077497_3	Therefore, support of cryptocurrency payment on mobile devices is a natural demand.
G08.1_3004077497_4	Considering the poor infrastructure and the low usage of financial service in developing countries, this combination is especially attractive.
G08.1_3004077497_5	The high storage cost and payment processing latency are two obstacles for cryptocurrency mobile payment.
G08.1_3004077497_6	We propose two solutions, one with a centralized bank and the other one without any centralized party.
G08.1_3004077497_7	We also provide a solution for the bank to meet KYC (know your customer)/AML (antimoney laundering) expectations about cryptocurrency mobile payment.
G08.2_1607424157_1	Motivated by recent financial crises, research efforts have been put into studying contagion effects (spread of market disturbances) and herding behaviour (individuals acting collectively without centralized direction) in financial markets.
G08.2_1607424157_2	Much less has been said about influence of financial news on financial markets.
G08.2_1607424157_3	We propose a measure of collective behaviour in financial news on the Web, News Cohesiveness Index (NCI), and show that it can be used as a systemic risk indicator, which signals probability of financial system crises.
G08.2_1607424157_4	We evaluate the NCI on financial documents from Web news sources and analyse the relation between financial markets and financial news.
G08.2_1607424157_5	We hypothesized that strong cohesion in financial news reflects variations in the financial markets.
G08.2_1607424157_6	Cohesiveness is a better measure of systemic risk expressed in news, than measures based on simple occurrences of specific terms.
G08.2_1607424157_7	Our results show that cohesiveness in the financial news is highly correlated with variations in the financial markets.
G08.2_2807531787_1	In this paper, I propose a methodology to study the comovement (correlation on profits on investment) between the entropy (randomness and uncertainty) of different financial markets.
G08.2_2807531787_2	The entropy is based on the components measuring the stock market in financial markets from selected developed economies (France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States).
G08.2_2807531787_3	I study how a shock in the entropy in the United States affects the entropy in the other financial markets.
G08.2_2807531787_4	I also model the entropy using different time variables and obtain a common factor behind the entropy movements in these four markets.
G09.1_2202800066_1	Mobile devices are very common in everyone’s day-to-day life.
G09.1_2202800066_2	Nowadays such devices come with many features of computers.
G09.1_2202800066_3	People can use these devices for diverse applications.
G09.1_2202800066_4	There are chances that these devices can be used for illegal activities.
G09.1_2202800066_5	The percentage of mobile phones or smart phones involved in cyber crimes is increasing.
G09.1_2202800066_6	So it becomes necessary to digitally analyze such devices with cyber forensics tools.
G09.1_2202800066_7	This paper discusses different types of digital evidence present in Microsoft’s Windows Mobile smart phones and how to acquire such devices.
G09.1_2202800066_8	Also it describes a forensic tool for acquiring and analyzing Windows Mobile devices and personal digital assistants.
G09.1_2921035272_1	Internet of Things (IoT) devices (devices connected to the internet, collecting and sharing data) will be used in digital forensic investigations in the future.
G09.1_2921035272_2	These devices have limited interfaces for communication, such as USB ports or WiFi/Bluetooth wireless interfaces.
G09.1_2921035272_3	Meanwhile, with an increasing focus on the security and privacy of user data, built-in encryption (which encode information) is becoming commonplace in devices.
G09.1_2921035272_4	This presents a significant challenge to digital forensic investigations, where data from IoT devices needs to be analysed.
G09.1_2921035272_5	This work explores the electromagnetic (EM) side-channel analysis literature for the purpose of assisting digital forensic investigations on IoT devices.
G09.1_2921035272_6	EM side-channel analysis is a technique where electromagnetic emissions are used for eavesdropping on the operations and data handling of devices.
G09.1_2921035272_7	The non-intrusive nature of EM side-channel approaches makes it a viable option to assist digital forensic investigations as these attacks require no modification to the target device.
G09.1_2921035272_8	The literature on various EM side-channel analysis attack techniques are discussed – selected according to their applicability in IoT device investigations.
G09.1_2921035272_9	The data obtained from our survey are used to identify promising future applications of the technique for digital forensic analysis on IoT devices.
G09.1_1965213295_1	The use of mobile phone forensics to investigate fraudulent activity is nothing new.
G09.1_1965213295_2	But mobile phones have evolved into smartphones, and fraudsters have evolved with them.
G09.1_1965213295_3	Smartphones have functionalities that can be used for data theft or inappropriate contact with other parties. They are out of the systems of the company and are not monitored or controlled.
G09.1_1965213295_4	Employers need to be aware of these risks when devices are delivered and have processes when suspicions are raised.
G09.1_1965213295_5	Detecting fraudsters with computer skills is a constant game of catch-up.
G09.1_1965213295_6	It's not only about playing catch-up with the cyberfraudster, but also the technologies that can be misused.
G09.1_1965213295_7	Moreover, the methods assisting fraudulent activities (still out of reach of company systems) are constantly evolving.
G09.1_1965213295_8	This means a company's intellectual property and sensitive data is at risk of sabotage or theft.
G09.1_2047319275_1	Phishers, people who attempt to trick people over the internet to steal their money, continue to modify the web pages used in their attacks to imitate websites of spoofed organizations and to avoid detection by phishing countermeasures.
G09.1_2047319275_2	Manipulations can be as subtle as changing the source code, which is the programming instructions, or as apparent as adding or removing significant content.
G09.1_2047319275_3	To respond to these changes to phishing campaigns, algorithms are used to detect phishing websites based on their content, employing a data set consisting of 17,992 phishing attacks targeting 159 different brands.
G09.1_2047319275_4	The results of the experiments using different approaches demonstrate that some can achieve a detection rate of greater than 90% while maintaining a low false positive rate.
M1_1_1	The period after exercise (1-8h) enhances the body's processes that reverse the effects of the exercise and promotes adaptation to the training.
M1_2_1	Nutritional strategies to optimize muscle recovery include proteins which are recommended to allow protein synthesis (production of new proteins which improve, for example, muscle mass) and carbohydrates to recharge glycogen stores (energy storage).
M1_3_1	Muscle contraction and consumption of leucine-rich protein (essential amino acid composing proteins) induce reactions which increase the protein synthesis.
M1_4_1	Consumption of 20-25 g of high quality protein after exercise and repeated every 4 h showed an optimal anabolic response (increasing muscle mass) of the muscles.
M1_6_1	Several studies showed that athletes are more likely to drink alcohol to excess (50-65% drink above dangerous level).
M1_7_1	Consequences of an excessive consumption after exercise are direct effect on the body but also indirect effect on the recovery due to an inappropriate eating and rest.
M1_8_1	Consumption of carbohydrates can partially counter balance the effects of alcohol on the recharge of glycogen stores but the effect on muscle protein synthesis are unknown.
M1_9_1	The aim of this study was to determine the effect of alcohol on anabolism and protein synthesis in humans during recovery following an effort an athlete could do (in rugby or football for example).
M1_10_1	We assumed that consumption of protein and alcohol (compared to protein only) would reduce protein synthesis.
M1_11_1	Eight healthy physically active men (3 trainings per week for at least 6 months) volunteered for this study.
M1_12_1	Subjects did high intensity exercise and just after consumed an alcohol-carbohydrate, an alcohol-protein or a protein drink in three separate occasions.
M1_13_1	Training consisted of eight sets of five repetitions of leg extension at 80% of their maximum strength.
M1_14_1	After 5 minutes rest, subjects cycled for 30 minutes at medium intensity,
M1_15_1	then 5 minutes at high intensity.
M1_16_1	Immediately following exercise and after 4 h recovery, subjects consumed a 500mL drink of protein or carbohydrates.
M1_17_1	A carbohydrate meal was consumed 2 h after exercise, according to recommendation for glycogen recovery.
M1_18_1	The 8 h period after exercise is an important phase for recovery but also the period during which blood alcohol level may be the highest after excessive consumption of alcohol.
M1_19_1	The alcohol consumption started 1 h after exercise with 6 drinks (60mL of vodka and 240mL of orange juice) and during 3 h.
M1_20_1	For the protein drink, orange juice was consumed with water instead of alcohol.
M1_21_1	Subjects consumed the drinks in 5 minutes every 30 minutes.
M1_22_1	Data (blood, protein synthesis, responses, etc.) were analyzed several times for the 3 different consumptions of drinks.
M1_23_1	The first finding of this study was that the mTOR enzyme (responsible for muscle growth) and protein synthesis (after exercise) were reduced by an excessive alcohol consumption during the 8 h period of recovery.
M1_24_1	Consequences were most evident when alcohol was consumed without protein (37 % reduction of protein synthesis).
M1_25_1	A second finding was that even with protein consumption, alcohol reduced protein synthesis by around 24%.
M1_26_1	mTOR is important in absorption of nutrients (like amino acids) and in sending signals to the body to produce an effort.
M1_27_1	The data from this study show that alcohol reduce the protein synthesis after exercise even with an optimal consumption of nutrients.
M1_28_1	The quantity of alcohol consumed in this study was based on consumption by athletes during binge drinking.
M1_29_1	However, reports show that some individuals can consume higher quantities, which is a concern for health and safety issues.
M1_30_1	Regrettably, it is difficult to find an educational message about alcohol consumption and sport performances that speaks to athletes.
M1_31_1	Considering the importance of protein synthesis (adaptation, repair and regeneration of muscles), the results of this study provide evidence of reduced recovery when alcohol is consumed after exercise, even with an optimal consumption of nutrients.
M1_32_1	We consider our data crucial for athletes and coaches.
M1_33_1	Our findings provide evidence for a message of moderation in alcohol consumption to promote recovery after exercise, with the potential to change sport cultures and athlete practices.
M10_42_1	In this paper we revisit a topic originally discussed in 1955, namely the lack of evidence that muscle growth plays an important role in increasing strength.
M10_42_2	To this day, long-term adaptations in strength are thought to be related to changes in muscle size.
M10_42_3	Given this assumption, training programs made for increasing both muscle size and strength were popular.
M10_42_4	However, the conclusion that a change in muscle size has an influence on strength is surprisingly based on little evidence.
M10_42_5	We suggest that these changes may be based on: (1) the weak correlation between the change in muscle size and the change in muscle strength after training; (2) the loss of muscle mass with the interruption of training, yet a maintenance of muscle strength; and (3) the similar muscle growth between low-load and high-load strength training, yet different results in strength.
M11_43_1	Low-intensity occlusion training, which is a training method with blood flow restriction, provides a unique beneficial training mode for muscle growth.
M11_43_2	Training at intensities as low as 20% of maximum strength with moderate occlusion results in muscle growth in 3 weeks.
M11_43_3	A typical exercise consists of 3 to 5 sets to muscle failure with short rest periods.
M11_43_4	The metabolic accumulation causes positive physiologic reactions, specifically a rise in growth hormone, which is one of the main hormone responsible of muscle growth, that is higher than levels found with higher intensities.
M11_43_5	Occlusion training is applicable for those who are unable to sustain high loads due to joint pain, postoperative patients, cardiac rehabilitation, athletes who are unloading, and astronauts.
M12_44_1	Current belief suggests cardio exercise training has minimal effect on muscle size.
M12_44_2	We and others have demonstrated that cardio exercise alters protein metabolism (responsible for protein synthesis and muscle growth) and induces muscle growth.
M12_44_3	These findings against the current belief provide a novel perspective on muscle mass regulation and insight into exercise to prevent muscle loss.
M13_45_1	Stretch training is used in a variety of fitness capacities such as increasing flexibility, preventing contractures (shortening of muscle) and reduce injuries.
M13_45_2	Moreover, some researches indicate that stretch training may induce muscle growth.
M13_45_3	The purpose of this review was to evaluate if stretch training is a viable strategy to induce muscle growth in humans.
M13_45_4	Of the 10 studies identified, 3 observed positive effects of stretch training on muscles.
M13_45_5	In these studies, the stretching was performed with external help like equipment or load.
M13_45_6	Of the 5 available studies that integrated stretching into strength training, 2 applied the stretching in the rest period between the sets and were the ones that showed enhanced muscle growth.
M13_45_7	In conclusion, passive, low-intensity stretch does not appear to produce beneficial changes in muscles but evidence suggests that when stretching is done with a certain intensity (particularly when loaded, or added between active muscle contractions), it may induce muscle growth.
M14_46_1	Cycling training is performed as a major part of any training program which objective is to improve cardiovascular capacities and health.
M14_46_2	However, the effect of cycling training on muscle size and strength still requires a better comprehension.
M14_46_3	Therefore, the purpose of this review is to discuss the effects of cycling training on muscle size and strength of the legs and the possible mechanisms for increasing muscle size with cycling training.
M14_46_4	It is plausible that cycling training requires a longer period to significantly increase muscle size compared to strength training due to a much slower muscle growth rate.
M14_46_5	Cycling training induces muscle growth similarly between young and older people, while strength gain seems to favor older adults.
M14_46_6	For young adults, series of high-intensity cycling may be required to achieve strength gains.
M14_46_7	It also appears that muscle growth induced by cycling training results from the positive changes in protein balance, which is the balance between protein intake which leads to muscle growth and protein loss which leads to muscle loss).
M15_47_1	Strength training is the most effective method to increase muscle mass.
M15_47_2	It has also been shown to promote many health benefits.
M15_47_3	Although it is helpful for treating and preventing diseases, a time-efficient and minimal dose of exercise has been the focus of a great number of research studies.
M15_47_4	Similarly, an inverted U-shaped relationship (which means that the efficiency increases until a point, and then starts decreasing) between training volume and physiological response has been hypothesized to exist.
M15_47_5	However, evidence supports a clear correlation between resistance training volume (number of exercises, sets, etc.) and physiological responses, such as muscle growth and health outcomes.
M15_47_6	Additionally, there is a lack of data to support the inverted U-shaped response.
M15_47_7	The principle suggested is that volume is the most easily modifiable variable that has the most important response, for muscle growth or health outcomes.
M16_48_1	The effects of short versus long rest intervals between sets in strength training on muscle growth have been investigated in several studies but the findings and the practical implications are unclear.
M16_48_2	Current evidence indicates that both short and long rest intervals may be useful for muscle growth.
M16_48_3	Novel findings suggest for trained people a possible advantage for the use of long rest intervals to induce muscle growth.
M16_48_4	However, due to the lack of studies with similar methodologies, further research is needed to provide a clear differentiation between these two approaches.
M17_49_1	Memory is a process in which information is encoded, stored, and retrieved.
M17_49_2	For vertebrates, it has been said that it occurs only in the brain.
M17_49_3	This review describes a cellular memory in muscles in which muscle growth is 'remembered' such that a fibre that has lost its mass, can regain it faster than untrained fibres.
M17_49_4	A new model, with the most reliable methods for identifying myonuclei (nuclei in muscle fiber), can explain this phenomenon.
M17_49_5	According to this model, previously untrained fibres recruit myonuclei from activated satellite cells (quiescent cells acting as a reserve population of cells for regeneration of muscle) before muscle growth.
M17_49_6	Even after grave muscle loss, the higher number of myonuclei is retained, and the myonuclei seem to be protected against programmed cell death observed during muscle loss.
M17_49_7	Fibres that have acquired a higher number of myonuclei grow faster during strength exercise, thus the nuclei represent a functionally important 'memory' of previous strength.
M17_49_8	This memory might be very long lasting in humans, as myonuclei are stable for at least 15 years and might even be permanent.
M17_49_9	However, myonuclei are harder to recruit for old people, and if the long-lasting muscle memory also exists in humans, one should consider early strength training as a public health advice.
M18_50_1	It has been hypothesized that eating small, frequent meals enhances fat loss and helps for better weight maintenance.
M18_50_2	Several studies support this hypothesis, with a link between the frequency of eating and being overweight.
M18_50_3	This review aims to present and discuss a research on meal frequency with respect to changes in body mass.
M18_50_4	Eating frequency was positively associated with reductions in fat mass and increasing in fat-free mass.
M18_50_5	However, the positive findings were the product of a single study, leaving a doubt about the beneficial effect of frequent meals on body composition.
M18_50_6	In conclusion, although the initial results suggest a potential benefit of increased eating frequencies for enhancing body composition, these findings need to be carefully interpreted.
M19_51_1	Per decade, inactive adults experience a muscle loss of 3% to 8%, a reduction of resting metabolic rate (energy consumed by the body at rest) and fat accumulation.
M19_51_2	Ten weeks of strength training may increase fat-free mass by 1.4 kg, resting metabolic rate by 7%, and reduce fat weight by 1.8 kg.
M19_51_3	Benefits of strength training include improved physical performance, movement control, walking speed, functional independence, cognitive abilities, and self-esteem.
M19_51_4	Strength training may assist prevention and management of type 2 diabetes by decreasing abdominal fat, reducing HbA1c which is a form of hemoglobin linked to a sugar, increasing the density of glucose transporter type 4, and improving insulin sensitivity.
M19_51_5	Strength training may enhance cardiovascular health, by reducing resting blood pressure, decreasing 'bad' cholesterol and triglycerides (main constituents of body fat), and increasing 'good' cholesterol.
M19_51_6	Strength training may promote bone development, with studies showing 1% to 3% increase in bone mineral density.
M19_51_7	Strength training may be effective for reducing low back pain, joint and muscle pain, and reverse specific aging factors in muscles.
M2_34_1	Physical activity has many benefits like preventing diseases and improving general health.
M2_34_2	In popular opinion, it is recommended to start intense physical activities like weight lifting and plyometrics (exercises like sprint and jumps) after adolescence.
M2_34_3	But this advice does not seem to be based on facts.
M2_34_4	We did not find any recommendation against strength training at a young age if it is well supervised with safety rules, medical clearance, proper instruction from a professional and progressive overload (gradual increase of stress on muscle and nervous system).
M2_34_5	Several studies showed many benefits of repeated, intense physical efforts in young people.
M2_34_6	Improved motor skills and body composition (muscle mass increased, fat mass decreased, healthier bone) were found in studies, especially if sport practice began during puberty.
M2_34_7	We can conclude that strength training is a safe and healthy practice for children and adolescents.
M20_52_1	Human aging results in a variety of changes to muscles.
M20_52_2	Sarcopenia is the age-associated muscle loss and is one of the main contributors to muscle disorders in older adults.
M20_52_3	Previous research has demonstrated that strength training can attenuate muscle function deficits in older adults, however few articles have focused on the effects of strength training on mobility.
M20_52_4	The purpose of this review was to present the effects of strength training on mobility for older adults with muscle function deficits and to provide guidelines that can be used with seniors during strength training.
M20_52_5	We present evidence that strength training can attenuate age-related changes in mobility, including improvements in walking speed, static and dynamic balance, and fall risk reduction.
M20_52_6	Older adults should be encouraged to participate in strength training activities, and should avoid immobility.
M21_53_1	Maximizing the muscle growth following strength training can be done by manipulating variables like exercise selection, exercise order, rest intervals, intensity of maximal load, and training volume (number of exercises, sets, etc.).
M21_53_2	A neglected variable that also may impact muscle growth is repetition duration.
M21_53_3	Total duration of a repetition is the sum of the contraction, the lengthening and isometric (static contraction) and is based on the tempo.
M21_53_4	We conducted a review and analysis of multiple studies to determine if modification of repetition duration can amplify the muscle growth.
M21_53_5	Results indicate that muscle growth is similar when training with repetition durations from 0.5 to 8 s.
M21_53_6	Using a wide range of repetition durations can be employed if the primary goal is to maximize muscle growth.
M21_53_7	Findings suggest that training at very slow durations (>10s per repetition) is less efficient for muscle growth, although a lack of studies on the topic makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions.
M22_54_1	Recovery from exercise refers to the time period between the end of exercise and the return to a resting or recovered state.
M22_54_2	It also refers to specific physiological processes occurring after exercise.
M22_54_3	Recovery of the cardiovascular system occurs across a period of minutes to hours, during which many characteristics of the system change over time.
M22_54_4	Some of these changes may be necessary for long-term adaptation to exercise training, yet some can lead to cardiovascular instability during recovery.
M22_54_5	These changes may provide insight into when the cardiovascular system has recovered and is physiologically ready for additional training.
M22_54_6	This review focuses on the most consistently observed blood flow adjustments and the causes that drive cardiovascular recovery and how they differ following strength and cardio exercise.
M22_54_7	First we focus on the effect leading to low blood pressure of cardio and strength exercise and associated mechanisms, which can progress to symptomatic hypotension (low blood pressure) and fainting.
M22_54_8	Finally, we focus on the practical application to maximize the benefits of cardiovascular recovery, or minimize the vulnerabilities.
M22_54_9	We will explore measures, and discuss how these can guide an athlete's training.
M23_55_1	Exercise and physical activity are key tools in the treatment and prevention of several medical conditions including joint disorders and diabetes.
M23_55_2	Exercise can reduce cardiovascular risk, inflammation, illness causing muscle loss, and hypertension, in addition to increasing physical functioning, strength, and cardio-respiratory capacity.
M23_55_3	Chronic kidney disease, a condition that affects around 10% of the population, is often neglected as a target for exercise-based therapy.
M23_55_4	Despite the vast range of severity in kidney disease, exercise has a potential role in all patients suffering from the condition.
M23_55_5	In this review, we summarise the potential important role of exercise in the management of kidney disease and how this form of 'medicine' should be used.
M24_56_1	Exercise with blood flow restriction (BFR) is used to increase strength in healthy individuals.
M24_56_2	However, its effects on individuals with knee pain are unknown.
M24_56_3	The objective is to determine the effectiveness of adding BFR to strength exercise for pain relief and improvement of function in patients with knee pain.
M24_56_4	We conducted a review and analysis of multiple studies.
M24_56_5	Studies that compared strength exercise with or without BFR to treat knee pain and function.
M24_56_6	The results showed that resistance exercises with BFR was not more effective than strength exercises for reducing pain and improving knee function in patients with knee pain.
M25_57_1	In Japan, 43 million patients had high blood pressure in 2010.
M25_57_2	The management of this condition and the importance of lifestyle changes for the prevention and treatment of high blood pressure has been recognized in Japan.
M25_57_3	In particular, increasing the levels of activities of daily living and physical exercise.
M25_57_4	In this review, we examined appropriate exercise prescriptions (e.g., type, intensity, duration per session, and frequency) for the prevention and treatment of high blood pressure.
M25_57_5	This review recommends full body cardio exercise at moderate intensity (i.e., 50-65% of maximum intensity, 30-60 min per session, 3-4 times a week) that focuses on the major muscle groups.
M25_57_6	Strength exercise should be performed at low-intensity without breath-holding and should be used as supplementary exercise, but it is contraindicated in patients with high blood pressure who have chest symptoms such as chest pain.
M3_35_1	Nowadays, people are interested in intermittent fasting (an eating pattern where you cycle between periods of eating and fasting)
M3_35_2	Nutrition is important for the optimization of sport performance so there is a concern about the effects of intermittent fasting on performance.
M3_35_3	Studies showed that there are no benefit in high-intensity, endurance or strength training while fasting.
M4_36_1	Physically active people encounter periods with limited time available for exercise.
M4_36_2	During such periods, the goal of training may be to simply maintain physical performance.
M4_36_3	Some people may also desire to maintain performance for prolonged periods, like athletes during competitive season or militaries during deployment.
M4_36_4	Endurance performance can be maintained for up to 15 weeks with 2 trainings per week, or with a reduction of 13–26 minutes per training, as long as exercise intensity (exercising heart rate) is maintained.
M4_36_5	Strength and muscle size can be maintained for up to 32 weeks with 1 strength training per week and 1 set per exercise, as long as exercise intensity (load) is maintained. In older populations, maintaining muscle size may require up to 2 trainings per week and 2–3 sets per exercise, while maintaining exercise intensity.
M4_36_6	Exercise intensity seems to be the key variable for maintaining physical performance, even with reduction of frequency and volume (number of exercises, sets, etc.)
M5_37_1	Nutrient timing is a popular nutritional strategy that involves the consumption of combinations of nutrients around an exercise session.
M5_37_2	Some people say that this approach can produce dramatic improvements in body composition.
M5_37_3	It has even been hypothesized that the timing may be more important than the total daily intake of nutrients.
M5_37_4	The post-exercise period is considered the most important part of nutrient timing.
M5_37_5	In theory, consuming the proper ratio of nutrients during this time allows the rebuilding of damaged muscle tissue and restoration of energy reserves, but also enhances both body composition and exercise performance.
M5_37_6	Researchers have made reference to an anabolic “window of opportunity” (a limited time after training to optimize muscular adaptations).
M5_37_7	However, the importance - and even the existence - of a post-exercise ‘window’ can vary according to a number of factors.
M5_37_8	Research is uncertain about the applicability of nutrient timing. Besides, the relevance of post-exercise nutritional intake concerning anabolism (increasing muscle mass) has been challenged by recent evidence.
M6_38_1	Lack of time is one of the most common reason for not exercising.
M6_38_2	The aim of this review was to determine how strength training can be time-efficient by evaluating research on training variables, advanced training techniques, and the need for warm-up and stretching.
M6_38_3	We recommend choosing bilateral (with the two arms or legs), multi-joint (multiple joints involved) exercises that include full dynamic movements and to perform a minimum of one leg pressing exercise (e.g. squats), one pulling exercise (e.g. pull-up) and one pushing exercise (e.g. bench press).
M6_38_4	Exercises can be performed with machines and/or free weights.
M6_38_5	Weekly training volume (number of exercises, sets, etc.) is more important than training frequency and we recommend a minimum of 4 weekly sets per muscle group using a load that permits to do 6 to 15 repetitions.
M6_38_6	Advanced training techniques like combining exercises with no rest or shortening the rest time while using lighter weights can cuts the training time in half, while maintaining training volume.
M6_38_7	However, these methods are probably better to increase muscle mass than strength.
M6_38_8	Finally, we advise exercise-specific warm-ups, and stretching only if the goal of training is to increase flexibility.
M7_39_1	Training frequency is an important variable for hypertrophy (increasing muscle mass) in strength training.
M7_39_2	The purpose of this paper was to conduct a review and analysis of multiple studies investigating the effects of weekly training frequency on hypertrophy.
M7_39_3	Results showed no significant difference between higher and lower frequency with the same training volume (number of exercises, sets, etc.).
M7_39_4	Analysis of studies with different training volumes showed better results for higher frequencies, although the difference between frequencies of 1 and 3+ days per week was small.
M7_39_5	In conclusion, there is strong evidence that resistance training frequency does not significantly impact muscle hypertrophy when training volume is the same.
M7_39_6	Thus, for a given training volume, individuals can choose a weekly frequency per muscle groups based on personal preference.
M8_40_1	A variety of training techniques have been suggested to support muscle growth.
M8_40_2	Forced repetitions/drop sets (use lighter weight or receiving help to continue the set), supersets (combining exercises with no rest), and heavy negatives (lowering phase of the lift), are pretended to enhance hypertrophy (increasing muscle mass).
M8_40_3	This article will explore the potential role of these techniques in promoting muscle hypertrophy and provide an insight into possible applications to strength training.
M9_41_1	Increasing muscle mass is the goal of many people who lift weights.
M9_41_2	Research is lacking, however, as to the optimal way to induce muscle growth.
M9_41_3	Bodybuilders train with moderate loads and short rest intervals.
M9_41_4	Powerlifters, on the other hand, train with high-intensity loads and lengthy rest periods.
M9_41_5	Although both groups are known to display impressive muscularity, it is not clear which method is superior for increasing muscle mass.
M9_41_6	It has been shown that many factors mediate the process of muscle growth and that mechanical tension, muscle damage, and metabolic stress all can play a role in muscle growth.
M9_41_7	Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to review the literature as to the mechanisms of muscle hypertrophy and their application to exercise training and to draw conclusions from the research as to the optimal way to induce muscle growth.
